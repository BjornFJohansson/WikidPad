This is the icon set assembled for personal use by Jan Stegehuis; it is now made available as an extra download for WikidPad. In advance to the set becoming the default set for WikidPad 2.0 and higher, in one form or another.

This icon folder can in principle be used to replace the current WikidPad icon set.
To do so, replace the current "icons" folder in the WikidPad program folder with this folder.
The icons also replace the current toolbar and other WikidPad system icons.

Be however aware, that a lot of the old default WikidPad icons are either not in this set or have a different name.

To use only a selection of the icons, copy them and paste them into the "icons" folder in the WikidPad program folder.

WikidPad itself has not been adjusted yet, to use the new icon set; this won't happen until version 2.0.
To make the icon set work with the versions untill 2.0, a number of adjustments have been made, to make things work.
This was necessary, since WikidPad uses a number of the tree icons as system icons and it won't start, without having those icons correctly available.

Because of that some icons appear twice in the set, with different names. The new name and the old name.
Some tree icons also have been replaced by system icons; these icons are:

cog.gif
date.gif
link.gif
note.gif
pin.gif
question.gif

The correct icons however are still available as:

cog1.gif
date1.gif
link1.gif
note1.gif
question1.gif

The pin.gif icon is not available anymore at all.
