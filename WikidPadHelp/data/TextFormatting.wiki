+ Text Formatting

As you type you can enter formatting commands in plain text.

++ WikiMarkUp

*bold*
_italic_


++ WikiHeaders

+ Heading1
++ Heading2
+++ Heading3
++++ Heading4
+++++ Heading5


++ TextWrap

When you type in a really really really really really really really really really really really really
long line you can tell WikidPad to rewrap it for you by pressing [Ctrl-W]. Try it on this line.

You can even change the wrap position by adding a wrap attribute such as \[wrap: 20] to your document.
[wrap: 20]
This changes the wrapping on the current WikiPage to 20 characters.

[global.wrap: 70]
This changes the wrap position globally to 70.

++ WikiLists

See BulletedLists on how You can easily create bulleted or numbered lists.

++ WikiTables

++ Escape Formatting

+++ Escape MarkUp
To create a section of text without any formatting, wrap that section in a "\<< >>" block.

You can also use this on a single line <<like here>>. Inside such escaped MarkUp no newline is allowed.

See ExampleEscapeFormatting

Before and after the begin and end tags only whitespaces are allowed on the same line, so a << without closing />> in the text does not prevent ALink from being highlighted.

+++ Preformatted blocks

You can use \<<\pre and >> to enclose blocks which have no special formatting (wiki words, italics) as the default escaping blocks but are shown in HTML as monospaced blocks and have exactly the same formatting as written in the source text.

This is helpful especially for programming source code.

Example:
<<pre
                      ^
                     / \
                    /   \
                   /_____\
                  (       )
                  |       |
                  |       |
                  |       |
                  |       |
                  L_______j
>>


+++ Hidden markup

Hidden markups are not published to HTML or shown in preview but are otherwise fully processed by WikidPad so you can enclose comments in it as well as attributes or todos which show up in tree.

A hidden markup is written as \<<\hide >> either on a single line (no newline in it) or as a block like the escaping markup.

<<hide
You can see this in [Edit mode] only, not in [Preview mode].
>>


+++ Escaping characters

To escape single characters, prepend them with a backslash. These characters are then interpreted as normal text, the backslash is suppressed in [HTML preview] and [HTML export]. If you want to really write a backslash, write two of them: \\.

With this, you can write \[brackets] or \*asterisks\* which are not seen as formatting commands by \WikidPad.


++ Tables

+++ Columns delimited by "|" [Pipe key]

A table is enclosed in <<| and >> tags which must be alone on a line as for format escaping tags.
Each line with text is a table row, cells are separated by the [Pipe key] "|".
Each table cell may contain WikiWords, *bold* text, and _italic_ text.

Tables show up properly in [Preview mode].

See ExampleTablePipe

+++ Columns delimited by [Tab key]

To use tabulators instead of vertical bar | as cell delimiters, use <<|t to start the table:

See ExampleTableTabulator


anchor: html
++ HTML tags and entities

You can also use <b>HTML tags</b> and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entities in WikidPad. Use preview to show the effect of them.
