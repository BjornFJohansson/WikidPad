++ Text Formatting

As you type you can enter formatting commands in plain text.

*bold*
_italic_
+ Heading1
++ Heading2
+++ Heading3
++++ Heading4

When you type in a really really really really really really really really really really really really
long line you can tell wikidPad to rewrap it for you by pressing Ctrl-W. Try it on this line.

You can even change the wrap position by adding a wrap attribute to your document.
[wrap: 20]
Changes the wrapping on this page to 20.

[global.wrap: 70]
changes the global wrap position to 70.

For creating bulleted or numbered lists, see BulletedLists.


+++ Escaping Formatting

++++ Escaping blocks
To create a section of text with no formatting, wrap that section 
in a "<< >>" block. Example:

escape formatting

<<
*This should be bold* ThisShouldBeALink
>> 

with formatting

*This should be bold* ThisShouldBeALink

Before and after the begin and end tags only whitespaces are allowed on the same line, so a << in the text does not prevent ALink from being highlighted.

++++ Escaping characters
To escape single characters, prepend them with a backslash. These characters are then interpreted as normal text, the backslash is suppressed in HTML preview and export. If you want to really write a backslash, write two of them: \\.

With this, you can write \[brackets] or \*asterisks\* which are not seen as formatting commands by \WikidPad.


+++ Tables

A table is enclosed in <<| and >> tags which must be alone on a line as for format escaping tags.
Each line with text is a table row, cells are separated by |. A table cell can contain wiki word links, bold and italic text. Tables show up properly only in preview mode.

Example:

<<|
ScratchPad| This is| *a table*
with two| rows and| three columns delimited by \| and \
                                                    with two lines in a cell
>>
