+ Insertions

Insertions allow to insert some dynamic text into preview and HTML export of a page.

This text can either be the content of another page or a list of links to WikiPages which are parents or children of a page or to pages which form the result of a saved search.

See ExampleInsertions.


++ Insertion Syntax
The tag begins always with '[:' then comes the _insertion key_, then a colon and the _insertion value_,
after that there may be appendices, separated by semicolons, to describe the way of presentation in more detail. The tag is closed by a closing bracket.

In the example above, "page" is the insertion key, "IncrementalSearch" is the value.


+++ Using Quotation Symbols 
The value and appendices can be quoted (enclosed by quotation symbols) if they shall contain special characters or newlines. A quotation symbol is an arbitrary number of one of the quotation characters ", ', / or \ (double quotation mark, single quotation mark, slash or backslash). 
The starting and ending symbols must be the same. 

See ExampleQuotationSymbols.


+++ Builtin _keys_ and _values_ 
The following keys and values are built into WikidPad (further are possible by plugins):

    * *page* shows the content of the existing wiki page which is
      given as insertion value. If it contains an appendix
      "adjheading" it adjusts the heading levels in the inserted page
      to the level of inserting page. See InsertPage.
    * *rel* lists all WikiWords related to this page in the way
      described by the value: See InsertRel.
        * *parents*: all parents of the page
        * *children*: all children (= all wiki links) of the page.
          With appendix "existingonly" only the really existing
          pages are listed
        * *parentless*: all parentless pages. The list is
          independent from the page containing the insertion tag.
        * *undefined*: all undefined WikiWordLinks. The list is
          independent from the page containing the insertion tag.
        * *back*: go back in history of WikidPad WikiTextEditorTab
          (or browser on export)
    * *savedsearch* lists all WikiWords found by the saved search
      with the name given as value. See InsertSavedSearch.
    * *toc* shows a little table of contents with the headings of 
      the current page. In [HTML preview]/[HTML export] you can click
      on the lines to go to the actual headings. The value of this
      insertion must be empty. See InsertToC.
    * *iconimage* shows the icon whose name is given as value.
      You can use menu "Format"->"Icon Name" to find the name of
      an existing icon. See InsertIconImage.
    * *eval* Evaluate the given Python expression and handle its
      result as if it replaces the insertion. You must switch on
      the appropriate option "Process insertion scripts" on the
      "Security" options page to make it work. See InsertEval.
    * *self* Shows the name of the current page. See InsertSelf.


++ Sorting Multi-Column Output
For insertion tags which produce lists of wiki links (all but the "page" and "eval" insertion), you can also have the appendix "columns 123" where 123 stands for the number of columns the list should have. By default, there is only one column.

By default such a multi-column table is sorted rightwards:

<<pre
A B C
D E F
G H I
>>

With the appendix "coldir down" it is sorted downwards:

<<pre
A D G
B E H
C F I
>>
