You can switch off the automatic generation of bullets/numbers with the "auto-bullets" option in the "Editor" menu.

You can also switch off the automatic indentation with "auto-indent" option:

    If this line is indented and you press return, next will be as well.



Be sure to indent your list, otherwise the following text is interpreted as part of the list and therefore indented in the HTML view.

Example:


* Part
* of list
