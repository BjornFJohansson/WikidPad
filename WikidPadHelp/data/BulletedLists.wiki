++ Bulleted Lists

To start a bulleted list type an asterisk at the beginning of the line.
For example:

    * Put your cursor at the end of this line and press enter.

The start a numbered bulleted list type a number followed by a period
at the beginning of the line. For example:

    1. Put your cursor at the end of this line and press enter.


    15.4.3. Put your cursor at the end of this line and press enter.


You can switch off the automatic generation of bullets/numbers with the "auto-bullets" option in the "Editor" menu.

You can also switch off the automatic indentation with "auto-indent" option:

    If this line is indented and you press return, next will be as well.


If a line has a "lonely" bullet or number on it and you press enter, the bullet is removed:

    * Put your cursor at the end of this line and press enter *twice*.


You can switch off this behavior as well in "Options" dialog, page "Editor", option "Auto-unbullets".


+++ Caution

Be sure to indent your list, otherwise the following text is interpreted as part of the list and therefore indented in the HTML view.

Example (switch to preview to see the problem):


* Part
* of list


After the list.
