++ Wiki Document Attributes

Wiki pages support "attributes". Attributes serve 2 purposes.  They
allow you to index your data by attribute, in addition to by wikiword,
and they are used to specify certain special wiki formatting commands.

You can attach attributes to a page like this:

[attribute: value]

Setting an attribute like this makes this document available under the
*Views* node in the tree on the left, under importance/high.  Example
attributes you might want to add to your wiki words might be:

[contact: work]
[contact: private] for wiki contacts, ie JohnDoe
[work-related: true] to mark something as work related
[contact.personal.kids: school] to mark something as personal contact
about school of the kids.

Open the "Views" node in the tree on the left to see how these attributes
become available for reference.

+++ Attribute Based Tree Formatting

There are 3 special attributes you can attach to a page that control
the appearance of the page's node in the tree. These attributes override any global settings (see below): 

icon: name (see TreeIcons)
color: (white, blue, etc., see TreeNodeColors)
bold: (true or false)

Example:
[icon: lens] changes the icon for this page to a lens.

These attributes can also be written in a todo item. If used there, they control the presentation of the todo entry (below the special "Views" node) instead of the wiki page.

Example:
todo: Show another color [color: orange]



You can also use global attribute properties to change the appearance based on the existence of other properties.

Examples:

[global.importance.high.bold=true]

This means any document in the wiki with an "importance" attribute
that has a value of high will be bold.
[importance: high]
So setting the above attribute is what made this document bold
in the tree.


If the global definition contains the first part(s) of an attribute the appearance is also changed.

Example:

Above we had already defined:
\[contact.personal.kids: school]

The following defines that pages containing attributes beginning with "contact" part have color Indian red:
[global.contact.color: indian red]

But the node isn't colored so because of this more specific definition to use dark orchid for attributes beginning with "contact.personal":
[global.contact.personal.color: dark orchid]


When creating a new wiki some default global attributes are
automatically attached to the root wiki document on the WikiSettings page.


+++ Autocompletion

Attributes also support auto completion. Try it:

Place cursor after the m and press CTRL-SPACE
[im


+++ Special Attributes

*priority: 1-5*
The priority setting will set the node text in the tree to
"WikiDocumentAttributes (3)" for example.  It also will affect the
importance setting of the node if "importance" is not already set.

[priority: 3]


*font: font face name*
Change the editor font of a page or the whole wiki.
See WikiFonts for example and details.


*alias: other page name*
Set another name under which a page can be linked to.

Example:
To this page can also be linked as WikiDocumentAttribute.
[alias: WikiDocumentAttribute]


*import_scripts: page to import scripts from*
See InlinePythonEval.


*child_sort_order: order how to sort child nodes in the tree*
Possible values are:
    * ascending: Sort alphabetically ascending
    * descending: Sort alphabetically descending
    * unsorted: Make no attempt to sort (fastest)
    * natural: Sort in order of appearance of the words on the page (may not always work)

You can also use the attribute global.child_sort_order to control the default for the wiki (without this attribute "ascending" is used)


*export: Export this page*
Control if the page containing this attribute should be exported. Only possible value is "false".
The HTML exporter respects this attribute, others, like the multipage text exporter, do not.


*template: page which content should be used as template*
See [Templates].


*pagetype: type of the page*
Controls some behavior of the editor.

Currently only type "form" is supported (see [FormPages] for details).


*language: language code*
Controls language of a page or the wiki (with "global." prepended) for [SpellChecking].


*html.linkcolor*
Specify the color of a link in preview/HTML export with a numeric HTML color (e.g. "#000000" for black).

*html.alinkcolor*
Color of a link while hovering over it with the mouse or while mouse is pressed (depends on browser). Doesn't work for preview.

*html.vlinkcolor*
Color of an already visited link. Doesn't work for preview.

*html.textcolor*
Color of normal text.

*html.bgcolor*
Color of background.

*html.bgimage*
Link (URL) to a background image. Doesn't work for preview.



+++ Error checking

The content of a page is checked on saving for logical errors in some of the special attributes. There is a log window below the editor (normally hidden) which shows error messages if something is wrong.

Currently it checks the attributes alias, color, icon and bold. The presentation attributes inside todo items are not checked.

The log window normally automatically pops up if new messages arrive and automatically hides when there are no more messages (both can be switched off in configuration dialog.

To test the error checking, remove the backslash on the following line and save the page:

\[icon: doesntexist]

Double clicking a message brings the editor to the offending attribute. Position may be a bit off if page was modified after saving.


[tree_position: 6]
