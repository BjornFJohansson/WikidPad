++ Wiki Document Attributes

Wiki pages support "attributes". Attributes serve 2 purposes.  They
allow you to index your data by attribute, in addition to by wikiword,
and they are used to specify certain special wiki formatting commands.

You can attach attributes to a page like this:

[importance: high]

Setting an attribute like this makes this document available under the
*Views* node in the tree on the left, under importance/high.  Example
attributes you might want to add to your wiki words might be:

[contact: work]
[contact: private] for wiki contacts, ie JohnDoe
[work-related: true] to mark something as work related
[contact.personal.kids: school] to mark something as personal contact
about school of the kids.

Open the "Views" node in the tree on the left to see how these attributes
become available for reference.

*Attribute Based Tree Formatting*

You can also use attributes to change the way a document appears in
the tree.  This is done by setting global attribute properties in the
wiki.  Example:

[global.importance.high.bold=true]

This means any document in the wiki with a "importance" attribute
that has a value of high will be bold.
[importance: high]
So setting the above attribute is what made this document bold
in the tree.

[global.importance.low.color=grey]

When creating a new wiki some default global attributes are
automatically attached to the root wiki document.

*Special Attributes*

There are 4 special attributes you can attach to a doc that will
override the global defaults. 

icon: name (see TreeIcons)
color: (white, blue, etc.)
priority: 1-5

Example:
[icon: lens] changes the icon for this page to a lens.

The priority setting will set the node text in the tree to
"WikiDocumentAttributes (3)" for example.  It also will affect the importance
setting of the node if "importance" is not already set.

[priority: 3]

*Autocompletion*

Attributes also support auto completion. Try it:

Place cursor after the m and press CTRL-SPACE
[im

*Fonts* 

Attributes can also be used to change WikiFonts.
