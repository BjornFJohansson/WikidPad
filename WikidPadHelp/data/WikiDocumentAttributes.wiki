++ Wiki Document Attributes

Wiki pages support "attributes". Attributes serve 2 purposes.  They
allow you to index your data by attribute, in addition to by wikiword,
and they are used to specify certain special wiki formatting commands.

You can attach attributes to a page like this:

[importance: high]

Setting an attribute like this makes this document available under the
*Views* node in the tree on the left, under importance/high.  Example
attributes you might want to add to your wiki words might be:

[contact: work]
[contact: private] for wiki contacts, ie JohnDoe
[work-related: true] to mark something as work related
[contact.personal.kids: school] to mark something as personal contact
about school of the kids.

Open the "Views" node in the tree on the left to see how these attributes
become available for reference.

+++ Attribute Based Tree Formatting

There are 3 special attributes you can attach to a page that control
the appearance of the page's node in the tree. These attributes override any global settings (see below): 

icon: name (see TreeIcons)
color: (white, blue, etc., see TreeNodeColors)
bold: (true or false)

Example:
[icon: lens] changes the icon for this page to a lens.

These attributes can also be written in a todo item. If used there, they control the presentation of the todo entry (below the special "Views" node) instead of the wiki page.

Example:
todo: Show another color [color: orange]



You can also use global attribute properties to change the appearance based on the existence of other properties.

Examples:

[global.importance.high.bold=true]

This means any document in the wiki with an "importance" attribute
that has a value of high will be bold.
[importance: high]
So setting the above attribute is what made this document bold
in the tree.


If the global definition contains the first part(s) of an attribute the appearance is also changed.

Example:

Above we had already defined:
\[contact.personal.kids: school]

The following defines that pages containing attributes beginning with "contact" part have color indian red:
[global.contact.color: indian red]

But the node isn't colored so because of this more specific definition to use dark orchid for attributes beginning with "contact.personal":
[global.contact.personal.color: dark orchid]


When creating a new wiki some default global attributes are
automatically attached to the root wiki document on the WikiSettings page.


+++ Autocompletion

Attributes also support auto completion. Try it:

Place cursor after the m and press CTRL-SPACE
[im


+++ Special Attributes

*priority: 1-5*
The priority setting will set the node text in the tree to
"WikiDocumentAttributes (3)" for example.  It also will affect the
importance setting of the node if "importance" is not already set.

[priority: 3]


*font: font face name*
Change the editor font of a page or the whole wiki.
See WikiFonts for example and details.


*alias: other page name*
Set another name under which a page can be linked to.

Example:
To this page can also be linked as WikiDocumentAttribute.
[alias: WikiDocumentAttribute]


*import_scripts: page to import scripts from*
See InlinePythonEval.


*child_sort_order: order how to sort child nodes in the tree*
Possible values are:
    * ascending: Sort alphabetically ascending
    * descending: Sort alphabetically descending
    * unsorted: Make no attempt to sort (fastest)
    * natural: Sort in order of appearance of the words on the page (may not always work)

You can also use the attribute global.child_sort_order to control the default for the wiki (without this attribute "ascending" is used)


*template: page which content should be used as template*
See [Templates].


*pagetype: type of the page*
Controls some behaviour of the editor.

Currently only type "form" is supported (see [FormPages] for details).
