+ Footnotes

Footnotes are numbers enclosed in brackets, e.g. [42].

As this might be a valid WikiWord also, you have an option to have footnotes interpreted just as WikiWords. See OptionsDialog#*Footnotes# as# wiki# words*

The following applies only if this option is *not* set for the current wiki:


If the same footnote (footnote with same number) appears multiple times on a page, the last appearance is interpreted as "anchor", all former are interpreted as links to this anchor.

In editor mode this means that double clicking or otherwise activating a footnote brings the cursor to the last occurrence of it on the page.

In [Preview mode], all but the last footnote are shown as links which lead to the last one.

You can try it with the [42] here or above. They all lead to the following anchor footnote:


[42] Here you can write something intelligent.


As always you can escape the footnote with a backslash: \[42].
