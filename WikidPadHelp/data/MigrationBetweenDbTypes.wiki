++ Migration Between Db Types

It is recommended to make a backup before applying the following procedures.

When migrating you will loose stored searches and the modification and
creation dates of the wiki pages!

Definition: The *data-directory* is the directory named "data" in the directory of your wiki.


Please read and follow every of the following parts which matches your desired migration.


+++ If you migrate from "Compact Sqlite":
    1. Start WikidPad
    2. Open your wiki
    3. Choose "Wiki" -> "Export" -> "Export wiki to .wiki files"
    4. Select the data-directory of your wiki as target



+++ If you migrate from "Original Gadfly":
If you are unsure if you want to go back to "Original Gadfly" later you should not delete the Gadfly database files in the data-directory (file "wikidb.gfd", all files with suffix .grl and the complete "index" directory) because they can't be recreated automatically (Sqlite db types can recreate their database files).



+++ If you migrate to "Original Gadfly":
If no Gadfly database files in the data-directory are present (file "wikidb.gfd", all files with suffix .grl and the complete "index" directory), you must copy them from another wiki with type "Original Gadfly" into the data-directory.



+++ For each migration:
    1. Start WikidPad (if not done already)
    2. Use "Wiki" -> "Open as Type" to open the wiki to migrate, but choose the new desired db type.
    3. Run "Wiki" -> "Rebuild Wiki"
    4. Close and possibly reopen WikidPad



+++ If you migrate to "Original Gadfly":
Other files than the following in the data-directory are not needed by "Original Gadfly" and can therefore be deleted:
    * file "wikidb.gfd"
    * all files with suffix .grl
    * all files with suffix .wiki
    * the complete "index" directory


+++ If you migrate to "Original Sqlite":
Other files than the following in the data-directory are not needed by "Original Sqlite" and can therefore be deleted:
    * file "wikiovw.sli"
    * all files with suffix .wiki


+++ If you migrate to "Compact Sqlite":
Other files than the following in the data-directory are not needed by "Compact Sqlite" and can therefore be deleted:
    * file "wiki.sli"

You can even delete the \*.wiki files, but do not delete the one \*.wiki file in the directory
above the data-directory!
