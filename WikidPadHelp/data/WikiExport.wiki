+ Wiki Export

The WikiDialog "Export" can be reached by the ["Export..." menu item] in the ["Extra" Menu].

This dialog is organized similar to the ["Import" dialog].

You can export your wiki as a single HtmlPage, a as a set of HtmlPages,
one WikiWordPage at a time, or in [Multipage text format].

You can select a few predefined operations from the "Wiki" menu:

	* Publish as HTML / Wiki as Single HtmlPage
	* Publish as HTML / Wiki as Set of HtmlPages
	* Publish as HTML / Current WikiWord as HtmlPage


Or you can use Publish as HTML / Other Export to show a dialog to choose other settings:

++ Export options

+++ What to export
Choose if you want to export current page only, the current page and all sub-pages (children, grandchildren...), the whole wiki or use "Custom..." to open the [SearchingTheWiki#To search all pages: Full search|full search].

+++ Compatible filenames
Uses ASCII-only filenames for exported files so that they can be transferred to other filesystems without compatibility issues. On MsWindowsXP and MsWindowsServer2003 the AppLocale utility (see http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/apploc.mspx ) might also help on export problems.

+++ Export to
You can export a single HtmlPage, one HtmlPage for each WikiPage, a [Multipage text format] file or a set of .wiki files (mainly interesting for Compact version to migrate to original).

+++ Destination file/directory
Here you can set where the exported file(s) should be stored. If file or directory is needed depends on the type given in "Export to". For XML and multipage text it is a single file, for other types it is a directory (because multiple files must be written).


When exporting as HTML all files in the FileStorage which are referenced by a RelativeURL (URL beginning with "rel://") in the exported pages are copied to a "files" directory in the destination directory. This does also apply to files in subdirectories of the "files" directory.


+++ Saved exports
You can store your current export settings and retrieve them later to do the same export job repeatedly.

+++ Save Export
Asks for a name for the current settings and saves it.

+++ Delete Export(s)
Deletes one or more selected export(s) after confirmation.

+++ Load Export
Loads export which is currently selected in list. Your previous settings made in the dialog are overwritten.

+++ Load and Run Export
Same as first hitting "Load Export" then "OK" to start the export. Double-clicking on a saved export in the list does the same.



++ Additional options for HTML exports

For the HTML exports you can choose if you want to:
    * export URLs to images as \<img> tags or as normal links
    * create a table of contents either as a tree or as a list.
      For a single HtmlPage, the TOC is at the beginning of the
      page, for a set of HtmlPages, it is a separate
      "index.html" file.
      Using "As tree" is recommended when exporting the whole or
      nearly the whole wiki, "As list" is better for small subsets
      of a wiki as the tree option gives weird results here.
    
The defaults for these options can be set in the options dialog.


++ Additional options for .wiki file exports
For the .wiki export you can choose if the files should have system encoding or UTF-8 with or without BOM (byte-order mark). The import function of Compact can't recognize UTF-8 without BOM correctly.


++ Additional options for multipage text format

+++ Version
Choose which version the file should have. If you use version 1 it can be read only by WikidPad 1.9beta6 and later. Version 0 can also be read by earlier versions but looses information.

+++ Write version data of pages
Export also previous versions of the WikiPages you export. Only available for format version 1 and later.

+++ Write wiki func. pages
Export also wiki-bound functional pages in the file. Only available for format version 1 and later.

+++ Write saved searches
Export also saved searches in the file. Only available for format version 1 and later.


++ Continuous export

In [Extra Menu] you can also choose "Continuous Export" which allows to start an export operation which is repeated automatically each time a page previously designated for export is modified.

The dialog for continuous export is the same as for normal export, but some export types are missing as currently only the HTML export types support continuous export. Also some of the saved exports are hidden if they refer to exports not supported by continuous export.

After you made your choices what and where to export and pressed "OK", WikidPad first makes an initial normal export. After that every change to a page is reflected in the export *after the page was saved to database* (manually or by auto-save).

If you choose the menu item "Continuous Export" again (which has now a checkmark), the continuous export function is switched off again. It is also automatically deactivated if WikidPad is closed or another wiki is opened in the same window.

A few drawbacks worth to mention:

    1. Changes on a page that affect other pages (e.g. adding/removing attribute "\[global.camelCaseWordsEnabled: false]") will not change the already exported pages until they are re-exported.
    2. The set of pages to export will be static under some circumstances. Especially if you start auto-export for all children of one or more pages, it will only export pages which were children when auto-export started regardless if new children are added later.
    3. If you export as a single HtmlFile, the whole HtmlFile must be recreated on each change so it is only recommended if you export a few small pages.
    4. If temporary (volatile) files must be created (e.g. generated from MimeTeX or GraphViz) there may be created new ones again and again on each change of a page filling up the "volatile" directory. Therefore it is recommended to make a final non-continuous export to clean up the garbage.
