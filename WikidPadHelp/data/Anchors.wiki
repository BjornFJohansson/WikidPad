++ Anchors

Anchors allow to jump to a particular position in a wiki page in edit and preview mode as well as in exported HTML pages.

Defining an anchor is done with:

anchor: here

The anchor tag must be alone on a line, no text before or after it. After "anchor:" you give the anchor a name which must consist only of letters A to Z (upper or lowercase), digits and underscore. It must not contain spaces, other special characters or non-English characters.

To go to a particular anchor in a wiki word, append a ! and the anchor name to the wiki word, e.g.:

[Anchors]!here

Clicking on the link moves the cursor after the anchor tag.


+++ Remarks

    * Anchors are case-sensitive, therefore "here" and "Here" are
      different anchors.
    * The anchor tags are invisible in HTML preview and export.
