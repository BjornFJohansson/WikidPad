++ Where Is The Data Stored

This depends on the used database type:

+++ Original Gadfly
The data for your wiki is stored in plain text under the data
directory of the directory your Wiki config is stored in.  There is
one file per wiki word.  The .grl and .gdf files are the database
files used to index your wiki words efficiently.

+++ Compact Sqlite (aka WikidPadCompact)
The data is stored in a single file named "wiki.sli" under the data
directory of the directory your Wiki config is stored in. This
database file is created by the Sqlite database engine and contains
the content of all wiki pages as well as the cache information for
fast handling of your wiki.
