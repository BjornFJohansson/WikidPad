++ Time View Window

The time view window presents pages related to a particular date, ordered by time. "Related" can mean different things, mainly date of last modification or of creation (currently only last modification is implemented).

The time view is far away from complete, so the look and behavior described here may change in the future.


+++ The Timeline

The currently only way to present the pages is the timeline which is a list of dates, each date with a background color representing the number of pages related to that date (white for zero and going darker for more pages). When moving over a date with related pages with the mouse a little window with a list of the pages appears.

You can then move into the window and click on one of the page names with the left or middle mouse button to open the page.

To let the timeline show another date range you can currently only click twice (not doubleclick) on an arbitrary date and enter a new one (similar to renaming files in Windows Explorer). After that the whole timeline refreshes according to your entry.
