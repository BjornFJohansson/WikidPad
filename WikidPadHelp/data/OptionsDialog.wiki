++ Options Dialog

The options dialog controls the behavior of the application and the currently open wiki. To open it, choose "Options" in the wiki menu.

+++ Application-wide

The following options apply to the whole application and therefore to each wiki opened in it.


++++ General options

*Minimize to Tray*
Minimized to system tray instead of the normal taskbar.

*Minimize on close button*
Pressing the close button on the main frame (the little "X") does not close but minimize WikidPad. In conjunction with "Minimize to Tray" it minmizes to the try area.

If you really want to close, use menu "Wiki"->"Exit" then or the context menu when right-clicking on the tray icon (if "Minimize to Tray" is active).

*New window on wiki URL*
When double clicking on a wiki: URL, a new instance of the application is started, otherwise, the current instance loads the new wiki.

*Low resource usage*
Try to reduce usage of Windows resources. Only interesting for Windows 9x/ME.

*Single process per user*
If you open a new WikidPad instance while another is already running, the new window is handled by the same process as the first one. This option has only an effect after restarting WikidPad. It is off by default.

Advantages:

    * You can safely open the same wiki in multiple windows (on the
      same computer and by the same user only!)
    * Less resources (esp. memory) are needed to run multiple windows

Disadvantages:

    * If one window is busy due to a search or database rebuild, all windows do not react.
    * If one window crashes (in fact the process driving it) all windows crash.
    * An IP-socket connection is needed for communication between
      processes. The connection is invisible for other computers on
      a network or the internet, but a personal firewall software
      may alarm you nevertheless. Also, if multiple user use
      WikidPad on the same computer at the same time, all must use
      their own home directory as configuration directory (this is
      the default).


*Statusbar time format*
Set the time format the statusbar should use to show modification and creation date of the current wiki page. The format can only be set by clicking on the small "..." button which starts the same dialog as used for setting the date format for the editor.

*Auto-show log window*
Automatically show log window if new error messages arrive (see [WikiDocumentAttributes]#+++# Error# checking ).

*Auto-hide log window*
Automatically hide log window if no more error messages are present.

*Sort order*
Choose the desired alphabetical sort algorithm for wiki words, todos, attributes in tree or PageListDialog.
The "C" order is the way previous WikidPad versions worked (uppercase letters first, non-English characters in illogical order at the end).
The new "Default" order sorts according to default order determined by the operating system. Normally, uppercase letters are sorted inorder (AaBbCc). If you want uppercase letters (more exactly: all characters but lowercase ones) before the rest (ABCabc), check
*Uppercase first*.
This setting has no effect for "C" order. Alphabetical sorting of children of a wiki word in tree is always inorder.

*App-bound hotkey*
Here you can define a hotkey to show or hide WikidPad (they may only work on Windows). Hotkeys work system-wide, not only if WikidPad is active.

In the text field you can enter a hotkey in the same way as the menu shortcuts are. Unlike menu shortcuts, you can also use "win" as modifier (like "alt" or "ctrl"), but the hotkey must have at least one of "ctrl" or "alt" modifiers to work.

The checkbox before the text field allows to temporarily deactivate the hotkey without deleting the field content.

There is also an option to set a second hotkey which is bound to the current wiki instead of the app. See OptionsDialog#*Wiki-bound# hotkey* below in "Current wiki" options.


++++ Security options

*Process auto-generated areas*
Experimental feature, use not recommended!

*Process insertion scripts*
Control if insertions with key "eval" should be evaluated as Python expressions or not, see also [Insertions].

*Script security*
Set the security level for script execution, see InlinePythonEval#+++# Security# concerns .


++++ Tree options

These apply to the tree on the left of the main window.

*Tree auto-follow*
The tree tries to always select the wiki word currently shown in the editor or HTML-view.

*Tree update after save*
After each (automatic or manual) save, the tree icons and shown children are updated. This may need some time and may create some flicker going from top to bottom through the tree.

*Hide Undefined WikiWords in Tree*
If a page contains wiki word links to non-existing pages, these are not shown as children in the tree.

*No cycles in tree*
If two or more pages reference each other (e.g. NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeA) these cycles are not shown. Precisely: if a child of a word is already an ancestor (parent, grandparent, ...) of this word, it is not shown.

*Position main tree*
Controls where to place the main tree (to the left, right, top or bottom)

*Position view tree*
You can also have a second tree which has the "Views" node as root. You can place it relative to the main tree (above, below, left or right) or choose "hidden" if you don't want it. 

*KNOWN BUG*: After changing the position of main or view tree, the trees do not react on clicks properly any longer. Restart WikidPad.



++++ HTML preview/export

See [Options HTML preview_export].


++++ Autosave

*Autosave active*
Save current page content to disk (if modified) after a few seconds of inactivity.

There are two delays which *both* must be exceeded before a save operation is triggered (if Autosave is active).

*Delay after key pressed*
How long to wait after the last keypress in the editor (default: 3 seconds). Recommended value: 1 to 5 seconds.

*Delay after page dirty*
How long to wait after the page was initially modified (dirty) after last save (default: 15 seconds). Recommended value: 15 to 180 seconds.


++++ Editor

*Plain text color*
Specify the color of plain text (like this one) in the editor by pressing the little "..." button to start the color dialog or by entering a numeric HTML color (e.g. "#000000" for black) in the text field. Leaving the field empty chooses the default color.

*Link color*
Set the color of links (URLs and existing wiki words, e.g. http://nowhere) in the editor. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Attribute/script color*
Set the color of attributes and scripts (e.g. <%"this one"%>) in the editor. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Background color*
(Works only partially). Specify the background color of the editor. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Selection fg. color*
Specify the foreground color of selected text. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Selection bg. color*
Specify the background color of selected text. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Text cursor color*
Set the color of the text cursor (the small blinking vertical bar).

*Sync. highlighting limit*
Limit of page size in bytes when to switch from synchronous highlighting (calculated after each keypress) to asynchronous highlighting (calculated in the background and shown when ready). Recommended value: 3000 to 5000 bytes

*Highlight start delay*
For async. highlighting how long to wait after key press (in seconds) before starting the highlighting work in background. Recommended value: 0.2 to 0.5 seconds

*Auto-unbullets*
When this option is active and enter is pressed on a line which contains only a bullet or a numbering without text, the bullet is removed. See BulletedLists for details.

*Append closing bracket on auto-complete*
When suggesting the completion for a bracketed wiki word, e.g. "[Not Came" you can decide if a closing bracket is suggested ("[Not Camel Case]") or not ("[Not Camel Case").


++++ Clipboard catcher
This page is only visible on Windows.

*Append after clipboard snippet*
Control what the ClipboardCatcher should append after each caught snippet.

*Avoid doubled snippets*
If the same text is pasted multiple times consecutively to the clipboard, it is pasted only the first time. Some applications execute a single paste command as mutliple pastes to the clipboard which would lead to multiple inserts without this option.

*User notification*
Choose if you want to hear a sound when a clipboard snippet is inserted.

*Sound file*
Choose the sound file to play (if you have chosen to be notified by sound above). If the field is empty, a default sound is played.


++++ Mouse

*Middle button without CTRL*
Set the reaction of a middle button click on a wiki word in editor, internal preview, tree or wiki-wide search results if CTRL is nor pressed while clicking. You can choose between opening the word in a new tab in foreground, in background or in the same (active) tab.

*Middle button with CTRL*
Same as before, but set reaction if CTRL is pressed while clicking the middle button.


++++ Searching

*Context characters* *before* and *after*
Chooses the number of characters to show before and after a found match as context in wiki-wide search. For an "anded" regex, the beginning of the page is shown with so many characters as the sum of the "before" and "after" values. Using context may slow down the searching a bit.

*Count Occurrences*
Counts how many matches a page contains and shows this number in parentheses after each page name in wiki-wide search results. This option slows down searching.

*Delay before auto-close*
Controls how many seconds of inactivity before the incremental search is closed automatically. 0 means "wait forever".


+++ Current wiki
These options apply to the active wiki only

*Footnotes as wiki words*
Interpret [Footnotes] (e.g. "[42]") as wiki words.

*First word at startup*
Wiki word which should be shown as first one each time the wiki is opened. If the field is empty, the last words when the wiki was closed is shown on opening.

*Default export dir.*
Set the default export directory into which exports should go.

*Title prefix*
Control the heading level of the initial main title of new pages and fill between one and four '+' in this field. Default is "++".

*Wikiword to title*
How should the main title of new pages be generated from the wikiword:
    * As is: Use wikiword as title
    * Add spaces: Add spaces to wikiword in front of each uppercase letter ("NewWikiWord" -> "New Wiki Word")

*Use link title if present*
If you came to a not yet created page through a titled link (e.g. [WikiWord| This is the title]) and this option is checked, the link title will be used as title of the page.

*Modif. date must match*
*Filename must match*
*Modif. date is enough*
See [FileStorage].


*Wiki-bound hotkey*
Wiki-bound hotkey to show/hide wiki. See OptionsDialog#*App-bound# hotkey*
