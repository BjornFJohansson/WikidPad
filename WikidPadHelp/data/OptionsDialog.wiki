++ Options Dialog

The options dialog controls the behavior of the application and the currently open wiki. To open it, choose "Options" in the wiki menu.

+++ Application-wide

The following options apply to the whole application and therefore to each wiki opened in it.


++++ General options

*Minimize to Tray*
Minimized to system tray instead of the normal taskbar.

*Minimize on close button*
Pressing the close button on the main frame (the little "X") does not close but minimize WikidPad. In conjunction with "Minimize to Tray" it minmizes to the try area.

If you really want to close, use menu "Wiki"->"Exit" then or the context menu when right-clicking on the tray icon (if "Minimize to Tray" is active).

*New window on wiki URL*
When double clicking on a wiki: URL, a new instance of the application is started, otherwise, the current instance loads the new wiki.

*Low resource usage*
Try to reduce usage of Windows resources. Only interesting for Windows 9x/ME.

*Single process per user*
If you open a new WikidPad instance while another is already running, the new window is handled by the same process as the first one. This option has only an effect after restarting WikidPad. It is off by default.

Advantages:

    * You can safely open the same wiki in multiple windows (on the
      same computer and by the same user only!)
    * Less resources (esp. memory) are needed to run multiple windows

Disadvantages:

    * If one window is busy due to a search or database rebuild, all windows do not react.
    * If one window crashes (in fact the process driving it) all windows crash.
    * An IP-socket connection is needed for communication between
      processes. The connection is invisible for other computers on
      a network or the internet, but a personal firewall software
      may alarm you nevertheless. Also, if multiple user use
      WikidPad on the same computer at the same time, all must use
      their own home directory as configuration directory (this is
      the default).


*Statusbar time format*
Set the time format the statusbar should use to show modification and creation date of the current wiki page. The format can only be set by clicking on the small "..." button which starts the same dialog as used for setting the date format for the editor.

*Auto-show log window*
Automatically show log window if new error messages arrive (see [WikiDocumentAttributes]#+++# Error# checking ).

*Auto-hide log window*
Automatically hide log window if no more error messages are present.

*Append after clipboard snippet*
Control what the ClipboardCatcher should append after each caught snippet.

*Sort order*
Choose the desired alphabetical sort algorithm for wiki words, todos, attributes in tree or PageListDialog.
The "C" order is the way previous WikidPad versions worked (uppercase letters first, non-English characters in illogical order at the end).
The new "Default" order sorts according to default order determined by the operating system. Normally, uppercase letters are sorted inorder (AaBbCc). If you want uppercase letters (more exactly: all characters but lowercase ones) before the rest (ABCabc), check
*Uppercase first*.
This setting has no effect for "C" order. Alphabetical sorting of children of a wiki word in tree is always inorder.


++++ Security options

*Process auto-generated areas*
Experimental feature, use not recommended!

*Process insertion scripts*
Control if insertions with key "eval" should be evaluated as Python expressions or not, see also [Insertions].

*Script security*
Set the security level for script execution, see InlinePythonEval#+++# Security# concerns .


++++ Tree options

These apply to the tree on the left of the main window.

*Tree auto-follow*
The tree tries to always select the wiki word currently shown in the editor or HTML-view.

*Tree update after save*
After each (automatic or manual) save, the tree icons and shown children are updated. This may need some time and may create some flicker going from top to bottom through the tree.

*Hide Undefined WikiWords in Tree*
If a page contains wiki word links to non-existing pages, these are not shown as children in the tree.

*No cycles in tree*
If two or more pages reference each other (e.g. NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeA) these cycles are not shown. Precisely: if a child of a word is already an ancestor (parent, grandparent, ...) of this word, it is not shown.

*Position main tree*
Controls where to place the main tree (to the left, right, top or bottom)

*Position view tree*
You can also have a second tree which has the "Views" node as root. You can place it relative to the main tree (above, below, left or right) or choose "hidden" if you don't want it. 

*KNOWN BUG*: After changing the position of main or view tree, the trees do not react on clicks properly any longer. Restart WikidPad.



++++ HTML preview/export

See [Options HTML preview_export].


++++ Autosave

*Autosave active*
Save current page content to disk (if modified) after a few seconds of inactivity.

There are two delays which *both* must be exceeded before a save operation is triggered (if Autosave is active).

*Delay after key pressed*
How long to wait after the last keypress in the editor (default: 3 seconds). Recommended value: 1 to 5 seconds.

*Delay after page dirty*
How long to wait after the page was initially modified (dirty) after last save (default: 15 seconds). Recommended value: 15 to 180 seconds.


++++ Editor

*Plain text color*
Specify the color of plain text (like this one) in the editor by pressing the little "..." button to start the color dialog or by entering a numeric HTML color (e.g. "#000000" for black) in the text field. Leaving the field empty chooses the default color.

*Link color*
Set the color of links (URLs and existing wiki words, e.g. http://nowhere) in the editor. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Attribute/script color*
Set the color of attributes and scripts (e.g. <%"this one"%>) in the editor. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Background color*
(Works only partially). Specify the background color of the editor. See "Plain text color" above for details.

*Sync. highlighting limit*
Limit of page size in bytes when to switch from synchronous highlighting (calculated after each keypress) to asynchronous highlighting (calculated in the background and shown when ready). Recommended value: 3000 to 5000 bytes

*Highlight start delay*
For async. highlighting how long to wait after key press (in seconds) before starting the highlighting work in background. Recommended value: 0.2 to 0.5 seconds

*Auto-unbullets*
When this option is active and enter is pressed on a line which contains only a bullet or a numbering without text, the bullet is removed. See BulletedLists for details.


+++ Current wiki
These options apply to the active wiki only

*Footnotes as wiki words*
Interpret footnotes (e.g. "[42]") as wiki words instead of normal text.

*First word at startup*
Wiki word which should be shown as first one each time the wiki is opened. If the field is empty, the last word when the wiki was closed is shown on opening.

*New page title prefix*
Control the heading level of the initial main title of new pages and fill between one and four '+' in this field. Default is "++".


*Modif. date must match*
*Filename must match*
*Modif. date is enough*
See [FileStorage].
