++ Options Dialog

The options dialog controls the behaviour of the application and the currently open wiki. To open it, choose "Options" in the wiki menu.

+++ Application-wide

The following options apply to the whole application and therefore to each wiki opened in it.


++++ Tree options

These apply to the tree on the left of the main window.

*Tree auto-follow*
The tree tries to always select the wiki word currently shown in the editor or HTML-view.

*Tree update after save*
After each (automatic or manual) save, the tree icons and shown children are updated. This may need some time and may create some flicker going from top to bottom through the tree.

*Hide Undefined WikiWords in Tree*
If a page contains wiki word links to non-existing pages, these are not shown as children in the tree.

*No cycles in tree*
If two or more pages reference each other (e.g. NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeA) these cycles are not shown. Precisely: if a child of a word is already an ancestor (parent, grandparent, ...) of this word, it is not shown.


++++ HTML preview/export

*Start browser after export*
Starts the current web browser after exporting one or more HTML pages or an XML document.

*Font name for HTML preview*
Enter the desired font name for the HTML preview. Clicking on the "..." button shows a list of available fonts.

*Props to (not) include in preview*
Enter here a regular expression of the properties you want to allow to be shown in the HTML preview. The RE is tested against a "normalized" property where the brackets are removed and key and value are separated by ": ". So even if the property is in the page written as "\[camelCaseWordsEnabled=false]", the RE is tested against "camelCaseWordsEnabled: false".

If you e.g. want to show the "alias" properties only, enter "alias: .* ". Other properties will then be hidden in the preview. The empty text field matches everything.

If you want to show all properties *except* those matching the RE, tick the checkbox to the eft of the "not".

If you press the "Ok" button of the options dialog, but the dialog doesn't vanish, instead this text field is red, then the RE contains an error and must be corrected first.

*Props to (not) include in export*
Same as above, but for the HTML export.


++++ Autosave

*Autosave active*
Save current page content to disk (if modified) after a few seconds of inactivity.

There are two delays which *both* must be exceeded before a save operation is triggered (if Autosave is active).

*Delay after key pressed*
How long to wait after the last keypress in the editor (default: 3 seconds). Recommended value: 1 to 5 seconds.

*Delay after page dirty*
How long to wait after the page was initially modified (dirty) after last save (default: 15 seconds). Recommended value: 15 to 180 seconds.


++++ Editor

*Sync. highlighting limit*
Limit of page size in bytes when to switch from synchronous highlighting (calculated after each keypress) to asynchronous highlighting (calculated in the background and shown when ready). Recommended value: 3000 to 5000 bytes

*Highlight start delay*
For async. highlighting how long to wait after key press (in seconds) before starting the highlighting work in background. Recommended value: 0.2 to 0.5 seconds

*Background color*
(Works only partially). Specify the background color of the editor by pressing the little "..." button to start the color dialog.


++++ Other

*Minimize to Tray*
Minmized to system tray instead of the normal taskbar.

*New window on wiki URL*
When double clicking on a wiki: URL, a new instance of the application is started, otherwise, the current instance loads the new wiki.

*Process auto-generated areas*
Experimental feature, use not recommended!

*Low resource usage*
Try to reduce usage of Windows resources. Only interesting for Windows 9x/ME.



+++ Current wiki
These options apply to the active wiki only

*Footnotes as wiki words*
Interpret footnotes (e.g. "[42]") as wiki words instead of normal text.

*First word at startup*
Wiki word which should be shown as first one each time the wiki is opened. If the field is empty, the last word when the wiki was closed is shown on opening.
