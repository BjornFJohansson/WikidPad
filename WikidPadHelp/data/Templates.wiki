++ Templates

If a non-existing page has only one parent which has a "template" property, the initial content of the new page will be taken from the page pointed to by the property.

The new page will (as always) only be created effectively after it is modified in some way.


Example:

Let's assume you want to record things you have bought,
each article on it's own page.


So at first create a template page: BoughtTemplate.

Then define this as a root page which uses the template:
[template: BoughtTemplate].


Now you can create subpages:

    * BoughtFoobaromatic (this is already created)
    * BoughtStopAndGoer (go to this to see the template)
    * NotBoughtAlsoTemplate (or to this page)
