++ Wikid Pad Help

*Description*

wikidPad is a wiki-like notebook for storing your thoughts, ideas,
todo lists, contacts or anything else you can think of that's
important.  What makes wikidPad different from other notepad or
outliner applications is the ease with which you can cross-link your
information.  Links in a wiki are created by typing in WikiWords.  A
wiki word is any mixed case word typed into the editor.  TodoList or
JohnDoe are example WikiWords.  The term wiki means "quick" in
Hawaiian, and wikis are all about quickly linking your information
together.

To activate or follow a Wiki Word link, *double click on it*, or type
CTRL-L when the cursor is in the word.

When your finished reading through the help document select "Wiki/New"
from the menu at the top of the application to create your own wiki.
Then just start typing text with WikiWords to create your wiki.
