++ Change Log


Mar. 09, 2006 (1.7beta1)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format for
"Compact Sqlite" databases. It is converted automatically
when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup beforehand
is therefore recommended!

Changes:
    * Introduced new db backend "Original Sqlite".
      See [WhereIsTheDataStored] and [MigrationBetweenDbTypes].
    * For "Set Date Format" dialog last 10 entries are remembered
    * Option to interpret image URLs for HTML preview and export
      either as images or as normal links (see [OptionsDialog])
    * Export dialog has checkbox to temporarily override this option
      setting.

    * Attribute \[pagetype: form] introduced to support special
      behaviour of the editor for form-like pages. (see [FormPages])

    * Support for global.child_sort_order attribute.
    * Support for \[child_sort_order: natural] (but not really
      stable). See [WikiDocumentAttributes].
    * Presentation attributes (bold, color, icon) in todo entries
      used to format the entry in tree instead of the page.
    * See [WikiDocumentAttributes].

    * When trying to run a script, but script security doesn't
      allow to run scripts, a message box appears to explain.


Fixed bugs:
    * No titled URLs/wiki words in tables
    * Invalid HTML anchors created
    * Exporting of raw .wiki files didn't work for
      "Original Gadfly" databases



Feb. 24, 2006 (1.6beta4)

Changes:
    * Commandline support for exporting (parts of) a wiki and
      deletion of personal configuration (see [CommandLineSupport])
    * Windows binary installer: Support for deleting config.
      files on uninstall
    * Support HTML tags in WikidPad

    * Support for wiki specific text blocks (see [TextBlocks])
    * Editing of text blocks files from within WikidPad as
      "functional pages", located under Views in tree
    * Editor font now changes instantly after saving page
    * Now at most one script is executed when pressing
      Ctrl-Number (search order: local page, imported scripts,
      global imported scripts page)

    * Better handling of property "camelCaseWordsEnabled" during
      database update/rebuild.
    * Gadfly database backend: Rebuild does no more loose
      creation and modification date of a page.


Fixed bugs:
    * Crash on non-ascii characters in path to wiki database
    * Refresh of text blocks menu didn't work
    * When word in tree node had no children but got one after
      update, no '+' icon appeared after refresh.
    * Problems with wiki-wide search and page search
    * Jumping to wiki word didn't work if cursor and word were
      at end of page.



Feb. 09, 2006 (1.6beta3)

Changes:
    * 'global.import_scripts' property introduced (see
      [InlinePythonEval]) 
    * Security option to control if scripts should be executed
      and (global.)import_scripts property should be respected
      (see [InlinePythonEval]) 

    * 'template' property introduced to use content of one page
      as template for children of another page. (see
      [WikiDocumentAttributes]).

    * Hierarchical global presentation deduction: e.g. a property
      'global.work.color' will be applied to pages containing
      'work', "work.somewhere", "work.somewhere.else" ...
      properties, except there is e.g. a
      'global.work.somwhere.else.color' property. This works for
      'color', 'icon' and 'bold' properties which control the
      presentation of the tree nodes (see [WikiDocumentAttributes]).

    * Differential user_extensions: A file in "user_extensions"
      now only needs to contain the  definitions which are
      different compared to the file in "extensions"

    * In configuration directory, a directory ".WikidPadGlobals"
      will be created if not existing
    * In ".WikidPadGlobals" a file "[TextBlocks].wiki" will be
      created if not existing. This file describes content of
      the "Editor"->"Text blocks" submenu and can be customized
      (see [TextBlocks]).
    
    * Bug in autoNew.py script fixed
    * Bug with renaming in "compact_sqlite" database fixed



Jan. 25, 2006 (1.6beta2)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format. It is converted
automatically when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup
beforehand is therefore recommended!

Changes:
    * No more brackets around wiki words in the "Open Wiki Word"
      and all other dialogs
    * Characters can be escaped with backslash and are then
      interpreted as normal text (see [TextFormatting])
    * New dialog to choose which pages to search for, to export
      or to print (see [PageListDialog], [Printing], [WikiExport],
      [SearchingTheWiki])
    * New options to control the auto save timing
      (see [OptionsDialog])

    * Some bugs fixed



Jan. 13, 2006 (1.6beta1)

Changes:
    * WikidPad and WikidPadCompact merged into one application
      (therefore the new version number) (see [DatabaseTypes])
    * In wiki-wide search cycling through found matching occurrences
      on a page with F3 or clicking on the little blue bar
    * Basic printing support (see [Printing])

      [http://www.somewhere.com/aaa/bbb |Somewhere]
      [ScratchPad |This text is shown in preview and HTML export] )
      The title of the link is not stored in the XML export!

    * Options to control timing behaviour of syntax highlighter (see
      [OptionsDialog])
    * Option to set background color of text editor (works only
      partially)

    * Bug fixed: non camel-case words starting with camel-case word
      (e.g. [WikiWord with something]) incorrectly recognized in tree



Dec. 29, 2005 (1.20beta4 / WikidPadCompact 1.5.5beta3)

Changes:
    * Extended table support: wiki words, bold and italic
      text can now be used in table cells and the ...
    * same support in todo items now works correctly

    * Per-wiki-option to define a fixed wiki word to show when
      wiki is opened
    * Regular expression support for page search (menu
      "Editor"->"Find and Replace")
    * For wiki-wide search, the number of occurring matches on
      a page can be displayed.
    * Function key F6 to switch between tree and editor

    * Some bugs fixed


Dec. 20, 2005 (1.20beta3)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format. It is converted
automatically when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup

Dec. 10, 2005 (1.20beta2)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format. It is converted
automatically when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup
beforehand is therefore recommended!

    1. *User interface*
        1. When choosing a wiki word to go to (by using the
           "view parents", "view parentless nodes", etc. menu 
           functions) you can in the dialog choose one or more wiki
           pages to *delete*, so e.g. all parentless nodes can be
           deleted at once.
        2. *HTML-Preview*. At the top of the editor window there are
           two tabs "Edit" and "Preview". If you click the "Preview"
           tab you see the rendered HTML-View of the current editor
           content. In the options you can choose the font face to
           use in the preview.
        3. *Completely new wiki-wide search dialog*. It replaces the
           "view saved-searches" function and its dialog. You can now
           edit the wiki while the dialog is open yet
           (=non-modal dialog). For details see [SearchingTheWiki].
    
    2. *New options to handle tree*
        1. *"Tree auto-follow"*: The tree tries to always select the
           wiki word currently shown in the editor or HTML-view.
        2. *"Tree update after save"*: After each (automatic or manual)
           save the tree icons and shown children are updated. This
           may need some time and may create some flicker going from
           top to bottom through the tree.
    
    3. Other
        1. *Faster startup* by caching initially created regular
           expressions in a file named "regexpr.cache" in the
           application directory. (Deleting it is always safe and
           recommended after changing WikiSyntax)
        2. Option to handle numeric only words (=*footnotes*) as
           wiki words or regular text. This option applies to the
           current wiki only
        3. In export dialog: option to use *compatible filenames* which
           contain ASCII-only characters, so sets of HTML files are
           more compatible to other filesystems.
    
    4. Fixed bug
        1. *WikiWord and [WikiWord]* were different words


Oct. 13, 2005 (1.20beta1)

    1. *Unicode support*. This means:
        1. Characters from any language in the text (if font and 
           operating system support them).
        2. Arbitrary alphanumeric characters (as defined by Unicode 
           consortium) for non-camelCase wiki words (if operating and 
           file system supports it), except numeric only words, like
           e.g. [42].
        3. Support for all characters in incremental search.

    2. Changes in *wiki syntax*:
        1. Before and after the tags to escape formatting (<< and >>) 
           only whitespaces are allowed on the same line. See 
           TextFormatting.
        2. Escaping spaces when executing a search as part of a link. 
           Example: This link
           WikiDocumentAttributes#creating# a# new# wiki .
           A # is escaped as ##.
        3. Arbitrary alphanumeric characters (see 1.2.)

    3. The *editor*:
        1. Drag and drop of text.
        2. Faster syntax highlighting. For pages bigger than 10 KBytes, 
           it is done in the background, so you might notice a delay 
           before the highlighting is updated.
        3. New menu item "Replace Text by WikiWord". Select some text you 
           want to move to a new wiki page, choose the item and enter the 
           name of the new page. On the old page, the text will be 
           replaced by a link to the new one.
        4. Possibility to change the date format for "Insert Date"
        5. New menu item "Wikize selected word" to convert selected words 
           to a valid wiki word.
        6. Menu and toolbar plugin to add a list of the children and 
           parents of a wiki word to a page.
        7. Menu plugin to create new wiki words with auto-generated 
           names. (Name looks like  [New124536] with a unique number).
        8. Right handling of numbered lists with multiple levels of 
           numbering (like this one). See also BulletedLists. Written by 
           Gerhard Reitmayr.

    4. The *user interface*:
        1. Submenu to choose colors similar to icons.
        2. In the dialogs "Open word" and "Search wiki" you can use
           cursor up/down to move between text field and the list below
           the field.
        3. "Set as root" menu item to choose an arbitrary wiki word as 
           root of the tree on the left.
        4. Add menu and toolbar items as Python plugins (no documentation
           yet, but example in extensions/referrals.py). Written by 
           Gerhard Reitmayr.
        5. Arbitrary nested todo and property entries in the View tree. 
           See WikiDocumentAttributes and TodoItems.

    5. *Options* dialog in the "Wiki" menu:
        1. "Minimize to Tray".
        2. "Hide undefined wiki words in tree". Undefined children words 
           of a word are not shown in the tree if this is checked.
        3. "Start browser after export". If this is checked, after 
           exporting HTML or XML, the standard web browser is started to 
           show the result.
        4. "New window on wiki URL". If checked, activating a "wiki:" URL 
           opens a new WikidPad window (only if   'Handle URLs with 
           "wiki:" by WikidPad'   was checked when WikidPad was 
           installed). If not checked, the same window is reused to open 
           the selected wiki.
        5. "Low resource usage". Uses less GDI and user resources on 
           Windows 95/98/ME, especially if minimized. Changing this 
           setting takes effect only after restarting WikidPad.

    6. *Internals*:
        1. Plugin manager by Gerhard Reitmayr.
        2. Slower but more reliable HTML/XML export.


Jan. 08, 2005

    1. Fixed shell hook for opening .wiki files. Found fix here:
        http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/20/245072.aspx
    2. Added a 4th heading size (++++).
