This version needs a rebuild of the index if you enabled indexed
search. This is done automatically in the background but may
initially lead to higher CPU load and incomplete results of index
searches.

Creators of derived WikidPad parsers should merge changes from
official parser

      layouts where ctrl-level has other layout than base level.

      the MsInternetExplorer preview.
      See [Options HTML preview_export#Show iframes inside IE preview]
    * Experimental: MsWindows: Option to let scroll-wheel scroll
      the window under the pointer. Doesn't work for some windows.
      See [OptionsDialog#+++ Scroll under pointer]
    * Index search: Highlight found terms and jump to one found
      term on double-click
    * Removed plus signs in front of headings in page structure
      view, used indentation instead

    * Several bug fixes regarding "whoosh" (index search)
    * Bug fixed: MsWindows: "Invalid handle" error on command line
      bridge insertion plugins
    * Bug fixed: Autocompletion for [Anchors] treated WikiLinks as
      WikiWords (no relative or absolute paths supported)

    * Internal, index search: Store a format number for search
      index and rebuild index if number doesn't match the format
      of current WikidPad version


++ Dec. 27, 2010: 2.1beta10

      if there are no contradictory "template" attributes in the
      parents but at least one "template" attribute exists.

      file format is supported now.
      See [WikiExport#+++ Additional options for multipage text format]
    * Fine grained import control of multipage text files: Rename on
      name collision, decide which data to import, decide if
      versioning data should be imported for each wiki page.

    * Simple log rotation for error log to keep maximum disc space
      needed for log at about 1 MByte. If log is over 512 KBytes on

      versions side-by-side with non-English UI language

    * New database format! It is recommended to make a backup before
      updating and run "Maintenance"->"Update cache" after that
