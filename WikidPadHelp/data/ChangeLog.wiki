Aug. 05, 2006 (1.7beta8)

Changes:
    * Official support for multiple windows with same wiki in
      them, but only in the same process (therefore necessarily
      on the same machine and by the same user), you can use
      e.g. menu "View"->"Clone Window" for that. This function
      is not meant as collaborative multi-user support. 
    * Option to handle new WikidPad windows by a single process
      (recommended if you want to open the same wiki in multiple
      windows).
      See OptionsDialog#*Single# process# per# user*

    * Better error handling if file access drops (e.g. accessing
      wiki db over a network). See WikiMaintenance#++# Reconnect

    * Option to minimize wiki if close button on frame is pressed.
      See OptionsDialog#*Minimize# on# close# button*



Jul. 10, 2006 (1.7beta7, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 83)

Changes:
    * "Fast search" text field in toolbar. See SearchingTheWiki

    * Error log file is now written in the same directory where
      configuration file "WikidPad.config" is, it has a new name
      ("WikidPad_Error.log" instead of "WikidPad.exe.log") and
      writes timestamps and version number for each new session
      where an error occurred.
    * More verbose messages/exceptions when executing
      scripts/evaluating expressions.

    * Optical changes in extension "referrals.py" (thanks to
      schnullibullihulli).
    * Menus slightly reorganized, some menu items are at other
      places and/or have another name.
    * Wiki specific option to set page title prefix
      (normally "++") for new wiki pages. This allows to freely
      choose the heading level.
      See OptionsDialog#*New# page# title# prefix*
    * Possibility to add (absolute) URL with file dialog (menu
      "Editor" -> "Add file URL"). 
    * Fixed exporter bugs: No newline after "Parents: ..." start
      line in HTML export, unnecessary newline after each item
      in bulleted/numbered list.
    * Bug fixed: "compact_sqlite" db backend lost creation date.

    * Help wiki is opened now in the same process so file suffix
      .wiki needs no longer to be associated with WikidPad to
      show help.
    * Internal: Different handling of clipboard copy which may
      fix a bug (or not).
    * Internal: Extension files are now loaded with universal
      newline support, so newline conversion for Linux shouldn't
      be necessary anymore.
    * Windows binary installer now supports installation for
      current user only (on NT-based systems) or for all users
      (if installing as administrator, you are asked how to
      install).



Jun. 02, 2006 (1.7beta6, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 80)

Changes:
    * Support for an additional "Views" tree which can be put at any
      side of main tree, also option to put main tree at any side of
      editor (layout change during session has bugs).
      See OptionsDialog#*Position# main# tree* .
    * Clipboard catcher: New option to insert at cursor.
      See ClipboardCatcher.
    * Option for showing line numbers in editor
    * If ++ title of page was unmodified since page creation, it is
      changed on page rename accordingly.
      See RenamingWikiWords#*Title# auto-rename*
    * Fixed bug: Upper case non-ascii letters were not found when
      opening a wiki word (e.g. "É" didn't find Éve).
    * HTML-tag <pre> is now handled much better.
    * Changed controls in spell check dialog to circumvent problems
      with some languages on Win 98/ME
    
    * Fixed bug: No preview if newly created page wasn't saved first.
    * Fixed bug: No preview if page contains plain text only.
    * Fixed bug: WikidPad didn't work if date pattern for
      creation/modification date in status line created/contained
      non-ascii characters.
    * Fixed bug: double-escaped relative URLs (could be seen e.g. if
      path has spaces)
    * Fixed bug: Copying text to ScratchPad didn't work if copying
      from ScratchPad
    
    * Internal: "C:\Windows" is no longer used as configuration
      directory if all other possibilities fail.



May 08, 2006 (1.7beta5, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 77)

Changes:

    * Clipboard catcher (Windows only): Every piece of text added to
      the clipboard is also appended to a wiki page if the clipboard
      catcher is active. There is also an option to set some suffix
      after each caught piece of text from clipboard (by default, a
      newline is added). See ClipboardCatcher.
    * File storage introduced: Copy files into a subdirectory of the
      wiki within WikidPad. See FileStorage.

    * Options to choose text colors for editor. See
      OptionsDialog#*Plain# text# color* and following.
    * Control background and text color of HTML export (and partially
      for preview) by attributes (for wiki or page) or by options for
      the whole application.
      See [Options HTML preview_export]#+++# HTML# page# settings

    * If a wiki word node is clicked which is subnode of an attribute
      node, the particular attribute is selected as it worked already
      for todo items.

    * New menu item to hide/show toolbar.
    * New menu item to keep window always on top.
    * New options dialog consisting of multiple pages.
    
    * Simpler function for some standard dialogs for scripts.
      See [ApiDocs]#stdDialog

    * Changed method to find configuration directory, more suitable
      for WikidPad on USB-stick and more reliable. See WikidPadOnUSB
      and ApplicationConfigurationFiles.


Bugs fixed:

    * Todo item part shows up twice in tree with same content if part
      is also right side of a todo entry. Now shows up only once.
    * Wrong cursor position after using bold or italic from
      menu/toolbar
    * "Show referring Wikis" in the "Plugins" menu didn't work
    * Exception when refreshing tree while "saved searches" node is
      expanded
    * Exception when trying to paste something non-textual from
      clipboard
    * Workaround for wxPython bug: Crash when showing colored menu
      items on Win 98/Me



Apr. 21, 2006 (1.7beta4, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 74)

Changes:

    * One or more of the characters .,;:!? can directly follow
      an URL and aren't counted as part of it. If you need such
      a character as last one in an URL, enclose the URL in brackets.
    * Attribute names can consist of all alphanumeric
      (unicode definition) characters.
    * Support for zoom in preview (with Ctrl-+, Ctrl-- and
      Ctrl-Mousewheel).
    * Better formatting of titles of newly created wiki pages
      (e.g. wikiword "URLViewer" now leads to title "++ URL Viewer"
      instead of "++ URLV iewer"

    * Bug fixed: Tree always visible on WikidPad start, even if
      made invisible before previous termination.
    * Bug fixed: Creation of new wikis didn't work
    * Bug fixed: Searches not saveable, saved searches not usable
    * Bug "reduced": Scroll position of page in editor not remembered
      properly. The fix may lead to some visible jumps: sometimes
      you will see the beginning of page for a short time before
      it jumps to the stored position. Moreover, even with the
      fix the stored position may be imprecise sometimes.



Apr. 16, 2006 (1.7beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 73)

Changes:

    * Better alias support. E.g. pages linking to an alias of
      WikiWord are now listed as parents of this word.
    * Support for relative URLS with rel: protocol, see [UrlLinking]
    
    * Initial support for checking special attributes for validity
      (currently only "alias", "icon", "color", "bold") with an
      own "Log Window" for error messages, see [WikiDocumentAttributes].
    
    * Support for spell checking, see [SpellChecking].
    * Todo items can now be terminated with newline or |
    * On multiple attributes of same name on one page (e.g.
      multiple "icon" attributes) the last one is now preferred
      instead of the first one.
    
    * Bug fixed: Cursor position on a page is now stored for
      each page even if page is not modified and saved
    * Scroll position of editor is now stored (during session) as
      cursor position already is.
    * Scroll policy of editor modified to better handling
    
    * Bug fixed: Command line export didn't work because of wrong
      default additional options
    * Bug fixed: Gaps between paragraphs in editor when using some
      fonts (e.g. Verdana) and asynchronous highlighting.
    * Bug fixed: Tree not shown if set invisible and then made
      visible by dragging splitter sash.



Mar. 24, 2006 (1.7beta2, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 70)

Changes:
    * Importer/Exporter for new multipage text format (mpt).
      See ([WikiExport], [WikiImport], [multipage text format])    

    * Tree node context menu allows now also choice of color and
      icon of a node as well as appending or prepending of 
      wiki words to a page.
    * Options to switch off automatic bullet/numbering creation
      and auto-indent (see [BulletedLists])

    * Introduced <\<pre >>  block to create preformatted,
      monospaced text
    * Todo items (e.g. "\todo:", "\track:") can start after
      arbitrary text now, not only at the beginning of a line.
      This is currently experimental! It might be changed back
      if user have problems with this (see [TodoItems]).

    * Display of modification and creation date of page in status
      line (customizable date format, see [OptionsDialog])
    * Support for changing of file suffix of page files in the
      config file (not part of options GUI) (see [ChangeFileSuffix])
    * Uses now also environment variable "USERPROFILE" to find
      configuration directory

    * Bug fixed: page-wide "Replace All" could run in an endless
      loop (e.g. when replacing "e" by "ee").



Mar. 09, 2006 (1.7beta1, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 63)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format for
"Compact Sqlite" databases. It is converted automatically
when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup beforehand
is therefore recommended!

Changes:
    * Introduced new db backend "Original Sqlite".
      See [WhereIsTheDataStored] and [MigrationBetweenDbTypes].
    * For "Set Date Format" dialog last 10 entries are remembered
    * Option to interpret image URLs for HTML preview and export
      either as images or as normal links (see [OptionsDialog])
    * Export dialog has checkbox to temporarily override this option
      setting.

    * Attribute \[pagetype: form] introduced to support special
      behavior of the editor for form-like pages. (see [FormPages])

    * Support for global.child_sort_order attribute.
    * Support for \[child_sort_order: natural] (but not really
      stable). See [WikiDocumentAttributes].
    * Presentation attributes (bold, color, icon) in todo entries
      used to format the entry in tree instead of the page.
    * See [WikiDocumentAttributes].

    * When trying to run a script, but script security doesn't
      allow to run scripts, a message box appears to explain.


Fixed bugs:
    * No titled URLs/wiki words in tables
    * Invalid HTML anchors created
    * Exporting of raw .wiki files didn't work for
      "Original Gadfly" databases



Feb. 24, 2006 (1.6beta4, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 60)

Changes:
    * Commandline support for exporting (parts of) a wiki and
      deletion of personal configuration (see [CommandLineSupport])
    * Windows binary installer: Support for deleting config.
      files on uninstall
    * Support HTML tags in WikidPad

    * Support for wiki specific text blocks (see [TextBlocks])
    * Editing of text blocks files from within WikidPad as
      "functional pages", located under Views in tree
    * Editor font now changes instantly after saving page
    * Now at most one script is executed when pressing
      Ctrl-Number (search order: local page, imported scripts,
      global imported scripts page)

    * Better handling of property "camelCaseWordsEnabled" during
      database update/rebuild.
    * Gadfly database backend: Rebuild does no more loose
      creation and modification date of a page.


Fixed bugs:
    * Crash on non-ascii characters in path to wiki database
    * Refresh of text blocks menu didn't work
    * When word in tree node had no children but got one after
      update, no '+' icon appeared after refresh.
    * Problems with wiki-wide search and page search
    * Jumping to wiki word didn't work if cursor and word were
      at end of page.



Feb. 09, 2006 (1.6beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 57)

Changes:
    * 'global.import_scripts' property introduced (see
      [InlinePythonEval]) 
    * Security option to control if scripts should be executed
      and (global.)import_scripts property should be respected
      (see [InlinePythonEval]) 

    * 'template' property introduced to use content of one page
      as template for children of another page. (see
      [WikiDocumentAttributes]).

    * Hierarchical global presentation deduction: e.g. a property
      'global.work.color' will be applied to pages containing
      'work', "work.somewhere", "work.somewhere.else" ...
      properties, except there is e.g. a
      'global.work.somewhere.else.color' property. This works for
      'color', 'icon' and 'bold' properties which control the
      presentation of the tree nodes (see [WikiDocumentAttributes]).

    * Differential user_extensions: A file in "user_extensions"
      now only needs to contain the  definitions which are
      different compared to the file in "extensions"

    * In configuration directory, a directory ".WikidPadGlobals"
      will be created if not existing
    * In ".WikidPadGlobals" a file "[TextBlocks].wiki" will be
      created if not existing. This file describes content of
      the "Editor"->"Text blocks" submenu and can be customized
      (see [TextBlocks]).
    
    * Bug in autoNew.py script fixed
    * Bug with renaming in "compact_sqlite" database fixed



Jan. 25, 2006 (1.6beta2, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 55)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format. It is converted
automatically when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup
beforehand is therefore recommended!

Changes:
    * No more brackets around wiki words in the "Open Wiki Word"
      and all other dialogs
    * Characters can be escaped with backslash and are then
      interpreted as normal text (see [TextFormatting])
    * New dialog to choose which pages to search for, to export
      or to print (see [PageListDialog], [Printing], [WikiExport],
      [SearchingTheWiki])
    * New options to control the auto save timing
      (see [OptionsDialog])

    * Some bugs fixed



Jan. 13, 2006 (1.6beta1, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 53)

Changes:
    * WikidPad and WikidPadCompact merged into one application
      (therefore the new version number) (see [DatabaseTypes])
    * In wiki-wide search cycling through found matching occurrences
      on a page with F3 or clicking on the little blue bar
    * Basic printing support (see [Printing])

      [http://www.somewhere.com/aaa/bbb |Somewhere]
      [ScratchPad |This text is shown in preview and HTML export] )
      The title of the link is not stored in the XML export!

    * Options to control timing behavior of syntax highlighter (see
      [OptionsDialog])
    * Option to set background color of text editor (works only
      partially)

    * Bug fixed: non camel-case words starting with camel-case word
      (e.g. [WikiWord with something]) incorrectly recognized in tree



Dec. 29, 2005 (1.20beta4 / WikidPadCompact 1.5.5beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 50)

Changes:
    * Extended table support: wiki words, bold and italic
      text can now be used in table cells and the ...
    * same support in todo items now works correctly

    * Per-wiki-option to define a fixed wiki word to show when
      wiki is opened
    * Regular expression support for page search (menu
      "Editor"->"Find and Replace")
    * For wiki-wide search, the number of occurring matches on
      a page can be displayed.
    * Function key F6 to switch between tree and editor

    * Some bugs fixed


Dec. 20, 2005 (1.20beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 48)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format. It is converted
automatically when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup
beforehand is therefore recommended! The conversion may need a few
moments, please be patient.

    * Basic table support. Example:

    <<|

    else| where?| elsewhere
    >>

    * The .wiki filenames have no more brackets
    * Option to forbid cycles in trees (see [OptionsDialog])
    * Option to filter properties to show in HTML preview and export (see [OptionsDialog])
    * A few bugs fixed. Among others:
        * Wrong line endings in clipboard
        * WPCompact: Missing RE prevents wrap text from work
        * WPCompact: Creation of new wikis and importing doesn't work (wrong formatver)


Dec. 10, 2005 (1.20beta2, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 44)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format. It is converted
automatically when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup
beforehand is therefore recommended!

    1. *User interface*
        1. When choosing a wiki word to go to (by using the
           "view parents", "view parentless nodes", etc. menu 
           functions) you can in the dialog choose one or more wiki
           pages to *delete*, so e.g. all parentless nodes can be
           deleted at once.
        2. *HTML-Preview*. At the top of the editor window there are
           two tabs "Edit" and "Preview". If you click the "Preview"
           tab you see the rendered HTML-View of the current editor
           content. In the options you can choose the font face to
           use in the preview.
        3. *Completely new wiki-wide search dialog*. It replaces the
           "view saved-searches" function and its dialog. You can now
           edit the wiki while the dialog is open yet
           (=non-modal dialog). For details see [SearchingTheWiki].
    
    2. *New options to handle tree*
        1. *"Tree auto-follow"*: The tree tries to always select the
           wiki word currently shown in the editor or HTML-view.
        2. *"Tree update after save"*: After each (automatic or manual)
           save the tree icons and shown children are updated. This
           may need some time and may create some flicker going from
           top to bottom through the tree.
    
    3. Other
        1. *Faster startup* by caching initially created regular
           expressions in a file named "regexpr.cache" in the
           application directory. (Deleting it is always safe and
           recommended after changing WikiSyntax)
        2. Option to handle numeric only words (=*footnotes*) as
           wiki words or regular text. This option applies to the
           current wiki only
        3. In export dialog: option to use *compatible filenames* which
           contain ASCII-only characters, so sets of HTML files are
           more compatible to other filesystems.
    
    4. Fixed bug
        1. *WikiWord and [WikiWord]* were different words


Oct. 13, 2005 (1.20beta1)

    1. *Unicode support*. This means:
        1. Characters from any language in the text (if font and 
           operating system support them).
        2. Arbitrary alphanumeric characters (as defined by Unicode 
           consortium) for non-camelCase wiki words (if operating and 
           file system supports it), except numeric only words, like
           e.g. [42].
        3. Support for all characters in incremental search.

    2. Changes in *wiki syntax*:
        1. Before and after the tags to escape formatting (<< and >>) 
           only whitespaces are allowed on the same line. See 
           TextFormatting.
        2. Escaping spaces when executing a search as part of a link. 
           Example: This link
           WikiDocumentAttributes#creating# a# new# wiki .
           A # is escaped as ##.
        3. Arbitrary alphanumeric characters (see 1.2.)

    3. The *editor*:
        1. Drag and drop of text.
        2. Faster syntax highlighting. For pages bigger than 10 KBytes, 
           it is done in the background, so you might notice a delay 
           before the highlighting is updated.
        3. New menu item "Replace Text by WikiWord". Select some text you 
           want to move to a new wiki page, choose the item and enter the 
           name of the new page. On the old page, the text will be 
           replaced by a link to the new one.
        4. Possibility to change the date format for "Insert Date"
        5. New menu item "Wikize selected word" to convert selected words 
           to a valid wiki word.
        6. Menu and toolbar plugin to add a list of the children and 
           parents of a wiki word to a page.
        7. Menu plugin to create new wiki words with auto-generated 
           names. (Name looks like  [New124536] with a unique number).
        8. Right handling of numbered lists with multiple levels of 
           numbering (like this one). See also BulletedLists. Written by 
           Gerhard Reitmayr.

    4. The *user interface*:
        1. Submenu to choose colors similar to icons.
        2. In the dialogs "Open word" and "Search wiki" you can use
           cursor up/down to move between text field and the list below
           the field.
        3. "Set as root" menu item to choose an arbitrary wiki word as 
           root of the tree on the left.
        4. Add menu and toolbar items as Python plugins (no documentation
           yet, but example in extensions/referrals.py). Written by 
           Gerhard Reitmayr.
        5. Arbitrary nested todo and property entries in the View tree. 
           See WikiDocumentAttributes and TodoItems.

    5. *Options* dialog in the "Wiki" menu:
        1. "Minimize to Tray".
        2. "Hide undefined wiki words in tree". Undefined children words 
           of a word are not shown in the tree if this is checked.
        3. "Start browser after export". If this is checked, after 
           exporting HTML or XML, the standard web browser is started to 
           show the result.
        4. "New window on wiki URL". If checked, activating a "wiki:" URL 
           opens a new WikidPad window (only if   'Handle URLs with 
           "wiki:" by WikidPad'   was checked when WikidPad was 
           installed). If not checked, the same window is reused to open 
           the selected wiki.
        5. "Low resource usage". Uses less GDI and user resources on 
           Windows 95/98/ME, especially if minimized. Changing this 
           setting takes effect only after restarting WikidPad.

    6. *Internals*:
        1. Plugin manager by Gerhard Reitmayr.
        2. Slower but more reliable HTML/XML export.
