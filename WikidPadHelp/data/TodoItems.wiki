+ Todo Items

++ Special Keywords

Special keywords enable you to track important items in WikidPad.

	* todo: I have to do this.
	* done: I have done this.
	* action: I have to act in this.
	* track: I am tracking this
	* issue: This is to be addressed
	* question: This is a question
	* project: This is my project


++ Escape Unwanted TodoItems

Unwanted TodoItems like e.g.:

    Interesting CD track: loud music

can be escaped:

    Interesting CD \track: loud music


++ Terminate TodoItems

A todo item ends either with a newline or with a vertical bar |. If you want to insert a bar into the item, you can escape it with a backslash.

Example: todo: This item ends here| This text is not part of the item any more.
todo: This does \|not end here.

Look in the "Views" subtree to see the todo entries.


++ Sub-Categories for TodoItems

These items supports nested sub-categories as well, for example:

todo.system.bugs.urgent: There is a bug in the system

This will create a "system" node in the tree under "Views/todo", which has a "bugs" subnode which has a "urgent" subnode...

++ See TodoItems in the ["Tree" window]

Now open the the ["View" item] in the ["Tree" window] on the left to see
how these todo items have been added. For example, open
"Views/question" and you will see a node named "This is a question."
