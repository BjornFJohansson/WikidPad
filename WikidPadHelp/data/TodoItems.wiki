+ Todo Items

In Wikid Pad "todo", "action", "track", "issue" and "question" are
special keywords that enable you to track important items under the
"View" menu in the tree.

todo: I have to do this.
action: I have action items
track: I am tracking this
issue: I am tracking this
question: This is a question
project: This is my project

Now open the views node in the tree on the left to see how these todo
items have been added.  For example, open "Views/question" and you will
see a node named "This is a question."

These items supports nested sub-categories also, for example:

todo.system.bugs.urgent: There is a bug in the system

Will create a "system" node in the tree under "Views/todo", which has a "bugs" subnode which has a "urgent" subnode...
