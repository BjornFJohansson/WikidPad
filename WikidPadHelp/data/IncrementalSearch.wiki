++ Incremental Search

When in a document type CTRL-F or F3 to start an incremental search.
When in incremental search mode anything you type becomes a search
string, and as you type you are brought to matches in the current
text. Typing CTRL-F, or F3 again will "Search Next".

To exit incremental search mode type ESC.

Incremental search supports regex. For example. To match the
word "incremental" or the word "search" in this document, type:

CTRL-F
incremental|search
Then type CTRL-F again to cycle through the matches.
