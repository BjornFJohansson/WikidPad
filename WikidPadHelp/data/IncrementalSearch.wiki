++ Incremental Search

When in a document type CTRL-F or F3 to start an incremental search in
the left field of the status bar.
When in incremental search mode anything you type becomes a search
string, and as you type you are brought to matches in the current
text. Typing CTRL-F, or F3 again or typing CURSOR DOWN or PAGE DOWN
will "Search Next" while SHIFT-F3, CURSOR UP or PAGE UP search
backwards.

To exit incremental search mode type ENTER.

Incremental search supports regex. For example: To match the
word "incremental" or the word "search" in this document, type:

CTRL-F
incremental|search
Then type CTRL-F again to cycle through the matches.


Further details of the behavior of inc. search:

    * Ctrl-F while text is selected in editor copies it to search
      field up to the first newline or up to 30 characters
    * F3 starts search field with last search entered
    * Search starts at cursor position (1.8beta5 and prior started
      always at page beginning)
    * ENTER terminates search and keeps last found text selected (if any)
    * ESC terminates search and goes back where search began
    * Clicking outside of the search field terminates search
    * If search pattern is found search field is green
    * If search pattern is not found search field is yellow
    * If search pattern is an invalid regex, color doesn't change


In the options dialog, page "Searching" there is also an option
"Delay before auto-close". Entering a number greater 0 denotes the
number of seconds of inactivity before incremental search is closed
automatically. 0 means "wait forever".
