+ Incremental Search

In order to start an incremental search in the left field of the status bar,
just type [Ctrl-F] or [F3] while You are in a document.

Now, being in incremental search mode anything you type becomes a search
string, and as you type you are forwarded to any matches found in the current
text.

Type [Ctrl-F] or [F3] again, or type [Cursor-Down] or [Page-Down]
in order to "Search Next". In order to "Search Backwards" just type
[Shift-F3], [Cursor-Up] or [Page-Up] 

To exit incremental search mode type [Enter].

Incremental search supports [regular expressions]. For example: To match the
word "incremental" or the word "search" in this document, type:

[Ctrl-F]
incremental|search
Then type [Ctrl-F] again to cycle through the matches.


Further details of the behavior of incremental search:

    * [Ctrl-F] while text is selected in editor copies it to search
      field up to the first newline or up to 30 characters
    * [F3] starts search field with last search entered
    * Search starts at cursor position (1.8beta5 and prior started
      always at page beginning)
    * [Enter] terminates search and keeps last found text selected (if any)
    * [Esc] terminates search and goes back where search began
    * Clicking outside of the search field terminates search
    * If search pattern is found search field is green
    * If search pattern is not found search field is yellow
    * If search pattern is an invalid regex, color doesn't change


In the options dialog, page "Searching" there is also an option
"Delay before auto-close". Entering a number greater 0 denotes the
number of seconds of inactivity before incremental search is closed
automatically. 0 means "wait forever".
