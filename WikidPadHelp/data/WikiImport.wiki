++ Wiki Import

The wiki import dialog can be reached by the "Wiki Import..." menu item in the "Wiki" menu.

It is organized similar to the WikiExport dialog.


*Import format*
Here you choose the type of import you want. Currently only Multipage text is supported (see [multipage text format]).

*Source file/directory*
Here you can set where the file(s) to import come from. If file or directory is needed depends on the type given in "Import format". For multipage text it is a single file.
