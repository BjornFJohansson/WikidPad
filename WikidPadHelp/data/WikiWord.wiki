+ Wiki Word

A simple \WikiWord is any CamelCase word typed into the editor.

Examples:

	* TodoList
	* JohnDoe

A \WikiWord can be CamelCase or [Not Camel Case].


++ What are wiki words?

\WikiWords are (at least by default) all words which start with an
uppercase letter and where at least one uppercase letter follows a
lowercase letter in the word (this is called "CamelCase", like e.g.
\WikiWord).

WikidPad also recognizes a word as a \WikiWord, if a lowercase letter
follows after multiple uppercase letters.


++ Examples

	* ABCd
	* ACLs
	* ADSs
