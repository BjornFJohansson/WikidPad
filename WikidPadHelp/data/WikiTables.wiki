+ Wiki Tables

++ Columns delimited by "|" [Pipe key]

A table is enclosed in <<| and >> tags which must be alone on a line as for format escaping tags.
Each line with text is a table row, cells are separated by the [Pipe key] "|".
Each table cell may contain WikiWords, *bold* text, and _italic_ text.

Tables show up properly in [Preview mode].
