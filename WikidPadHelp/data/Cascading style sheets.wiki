+ Cascading style sheets

Cascading style sheets (in short: CSS) are a way to control the rendering of an HtmlFile in great detail. When exporting HTML from WikidPad, certain CSS files are copied to the export directory and referenced by the generated HTML page(s). They are also respected for the external MsInternetExplorer preview, the internal preview ignores them.

++ Search order

WikidPad searches in the following places for CSS files to copy and reference:

   * File "appbase.css" in the [WikidPad installation directory], copied as
     "appbase.css". You should not modify it as it is overwritten at
     each update of WikidPad
   * File "wikistyle.css" in install subdirectory "export", copied as "admbase.css"
   * File "wikistyle.css" in subdirectory ".WikidPadGlobals" or
     "WikidPadGlobals" of user-specific [configuration directory], copied
     as "userbase.css"
   * File "wikistyle.css" in subdirectory "data" of wiki directory,
     copied as "wikistyle.css"


Settings in a file overwrite same settings in files above it.


++ In PreView

In preview, three additional files are taken into account:

These files overwrite settings in the files above.

   * File "wikipreview.css" in install subdirectory "export"
   * File "wikipreview.css" in subdirectory ".WikidPadGlobals" or
     "WikidPadGlobals" of user-specific [configuration directory]
   * File "wikipreview.css" in subdirectory "data" of wiki directory

Use these, if you want the preview to look differently.


To find your user-specific [configuration directory] see [Menu Help]!About and scroll to the end to find out where it is.
