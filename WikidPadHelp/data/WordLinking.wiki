++ Word Linking

As you type wiki words into the editor they become underlined.  Words
that already have content, like AutoCompletion turn blue, words that
do not, like JavaTemplates, stay black but are underlined.

To activate or follow a Wiki Word link, *double click on it*, or
type CTRL-L when the cursor is in the word.
