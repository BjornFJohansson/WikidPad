++ Word Linking

As you type wiki words into the editor they become underlined.  Words
that already have content, like AutoCompletion turn blue, words that
do not, like JavaTemplates, stay black but are underlined.

To activate or follow a wiki word link, *double click on it*, or
type  8Ctrl-L] when the cursor is in the word.


+++ What are wiki words?

Wiki words are (at least by default) all words which start with an
uppercase letter and where at least one uppercase letter follows a
lowercase letter in the word (this is called "camelcase", like e.g.
WikiWord) or where a lowercase letter follows after multiple uppercase
letters (ABCd).

+++ Exclude wiki words from linking

To exclude a wiki word from being interpreted as link, you can precede
it with a backslash \ (e.g. \WikiWord) or enter it in the global or
wiki-wide camelcase blacklist (open the "Views" node in the tree on
the left, open therein the "Func. pages" node and click on 
"Global cc. blacklist" or "Wiki cc. blacklist". Then enter the word on
a line of its own in the list (e.g. URLs is in the "Wiki cc.
blacklist").
