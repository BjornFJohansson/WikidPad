+ Wiki Lock File

If the same wiki is opened by different WikidPad processes at the same
time, this can lead to data corruption. To avoid this, WikidPad creates 
a lock file when opening a wiki.

If another process now tries to open the same wiki, you get a warning
that you should not open the wiki again.

You may ignore this warning, if e.g. WikidPad terminated abnormally
before, and thus left the lock file behind.

The lock file is placed in the same directory where the configuration
file for the wiki is. It has the name of this config. file plus a
".lock" suffix and is empty. If the wiki is detected to be read-only,
no lock file is created.


++ Options

The "Advanced" page in the options dialog provides two options to
control the lock file behavior. Change this only if this is
absolutely necessary.


+++++ Ignore wiki lock file
(Default: off) When checked, a wiki is opened without warning even 
if a lock file is already present.


+++++ Create wiki lock file 
(Default: on) When not checked, no lock file is created when opening
a wiki (and thus, not deleted when closing it).

Note: This setting does not affect the behavior of the wikis already opened.
