++ Rebuilding wiki

In menu "Wiki"->"Rebuild Wiki".

This will completely rebuild the internal database for the wiki. This is sometimes necessary if program previously terminated abnormally or if datafiles were deleted or added from outside of WikidPad.

This feature can also be used to add large numbers of pages to the
wiki.  Copy ".wiki" wikiword files into the data directory, then "Rebuild Wiki" to rebuild the database to include these files. This does not work for "Compact Sqlite" database type (see MigrationBetweenDbTypes for details).

++ Vacuum wiki

In menu "Wiki"->"Vacuum". This function is only available if currently loaded wiki is of type "Original Sqlite" or "Compact Sqlite".

If information is deleted from an Sqlite database, the occupied hard disk space is not freed but later reused for new information to add. "Vacuum" makes this space available for the system again. After deleting large parts of a wiki, you can use "Vacuum" to free space, especially recommended for a "Compact Sqlite" wiki (where the page content is also stored in the database).


++ Reconnect

In menu "Wiki"->"Reconnect".

If during a WikidPad session the access to the wiki database files is lost (e.g. network connection drops), you might get an error. To make WikidPad work again after access is reestablished, use "Reconnect".

Initially, WikidPad tries automatically to reconnect and asks if it should try to reconnect each time you try to open another page or try to save a page.

Autosave is automatically disabled after an error until a successful reconnect.


++ Other things


+++ Finding and connecting parentless nodes

As you add and remove links from the various pages in your wiki
database you may end up with unlinked, or parentless, nodes.  To view
parentless nodes select:

Wiki Word/View Parentless Nodes
or press Ctrl-Shift-Up

You can then decide if you need to relink these nodes, or if you want
to delete them via the CTRL-D delete command.

anchor: finding_undefined_links
+++ Finding undefined wiki word links

There may be also wiki word links to pages which do not exist, e. g. NonExisting. These are underlined and black in the editor. To list all such links, use the "undefined-nodes" node in the "Views" subtree. If you click on one of these links you go to an empty page for this word and can fill it with content.

Sometimes words are unintentionally marked as wiki words. In this case you can either:

    * Prefix the word with a backslash
    * Add the attribute \[camelCaseWordsEnabled: false] on a page
    * Enter the word into one of the blacklists, see WordLinking!exclude_from_linking.
