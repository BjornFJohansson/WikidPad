+ Wikid Pad

WikidPad is a [wiki]-like notebook for storing your thoughts, ideas,
todo lists, contacts or anything else you can think of that's
important.  What makes WikidPad different from other notepad or
outliner applications is the ease with which you can cross-link your
information.  Links in a wiki are created by typing CamelCase WikiWords.
