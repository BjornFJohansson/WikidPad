+ Changing Key Bindings

There is a directory called "extensions" below the [installation directory]. 
In this directory there is a file called "keybindings.py". 
This file contains the variables used by WikidPad to assign KeyBindings.
Copy this file into the directory called "user_extensions" 
below the [installation directory] (create it if it doesn't exist) .
Edit this file to override the default key bindings. 
This file will not be touched when You [upgrade WikidPad].

file:///C:/Program%20Files/WikidPad/extensions/KeyBindings.py
file:///C:/Program%20Files/WikidPad/user_extensions/KeyBindings.py

Please note that if you change this file you should keep a backup of it
outside of the WikidPad directory so that if/when you [upgrade WikidPad]
in the future you don't lose your key bindings.
