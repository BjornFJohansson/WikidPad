When you type a WikiWord into the WikiTextEditor, it becomes underlined.

	* words having content already turn *blue*, like AutoCompletion
	* words that don't stay *black* but are underlined, like JavaTemplates.

To activate or follow a WikiWordLink, just *double click on it*!
Or type [Ctrl-L] while the cursor is in the word.
