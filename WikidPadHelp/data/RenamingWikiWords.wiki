++ Renaming Wiki Words

You can rename the current wiki word from the menu, or via the 
CTRL-ALT-R command.

*What Happens*

The Wiki Pad database is updated with the renamed word.  All of the
relationships, attributes, and todos are re-linked.  Then, all of the
.wiki files in the data directory that have links to the renamed word
have their references updated.  For a large wiki this could be a
relatively slow operation.
