++ Url Linking

You may enter URLs to websites or local files into your document.  To
open the link double click on it or press the Ctrl-L. If you drag a
file from Windows explorer onto wikidPad a link will be created for
you.

Example:

http://www.google.com/ 
https://somewheresecure.com
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/joeshmoe/readme.txt
ftp://ftp.whereever.com/

To create an absolute URL to a file you can also use "Add file URL" in "Editor" menu and choose the desired file in file dialog.


++ Relative URLs
You can create URLs which are relative to the wiki directory. These start with rel:// followed by the relative position. For HTML export the rel:// is removed to create a relative HTML link (without protocol). For HTML preview they are converted to "file:" URLs.

You can drag a file from Windows Explorer while holding shift key to create a relative URL. This does not work with files ending with ".wiki", these are always absolute and have the "wiki:" protocol.

Example:

rel://../above/andBelow.txt


++ File storage
You can also copy files into a subdirectory of the wiki directory from within WikidPad. See [FileStorage] for details.
