++ Database Types

WikidPad supports different database backends to store the wiki pages (see [WhereIsTheDataStored] for the differences).

In some places you are asked which backend to use:


+++ The Windows binary installer
When using the Windows binary installer you are asked if you want to install the Gadfly and/or Sqlite database support. You should choose at least one option, otherwise you wont be able to open any wiki database!


+++ Creating a new wiki
After choosing name and position of the new wiki you are asked to choose the database type.


+++ Opening an older wiki
If you open the first time wiki created by an older version of WikidPad(Compact) you are asked to choose the database type it has.

If it was created by original WikidPad the right choice is "Original Gadfly", for WikidPadCompact it is "Compact Sqlite". Your choice will be stored in the wiki configuration file so the application will choose the right type automatically next time.


+++ Overriding type on open
If you open a wiki with "Open as Type", you are always asked for the database type to use. This is helpful when migrating from one database backend to another.
