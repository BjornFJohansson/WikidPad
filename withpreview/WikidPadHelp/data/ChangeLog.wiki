# Added a "Preview" tab that renders the current wiki word as html. Images are
  rendered inline. 
  
  Example: !http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif!
  
# Added support for named links. Example: "Google":http://www.google.com. The names
  can only contain characters and _ or -. The names will show up in preview mode or
  in exports. Another example: mail "wikidpad":wikidPad@jhorman.org

# Fixed shell hook for opening .wiki files. Found fix here:
  http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/20/245072.aspx
# Added a 4th heading size (++++).

Dec. 13, 2004

# Added support for [export:false] attribute.  Setting this attribute
   to false will cause it to not be included in exports.
# Fixed issue with international characters in [Not Camel Case] links
  (thanks to Gilles Lenfant).
# [Not Camel Case] links also now autocomplete properly.

Nov. 14, 2004

# Added ability to RebuildTheWiki from disk.

Oct. 11, 2004

# Added support for sub-tree export.
# Exports now (attempt) to indent indented text using <blockquote>.
# Python runtime updated.
# I attempted to update to the latest wxWindows and things didn't go
  well. Ended up reverting back.
# Additional minor fixes.

# Added child_sort_order attribute support.  A parent node can set
  child_sort_order to "ascending", "descending", or "unsorted" to control
  the order of the child nodes in the tree.
       
       [child_sort_order: unsorted]
       
# User can now place their extensions in "user_extensions" under the
  wikidPad install directory.  This directory will not be touched when
  upgrading wikidPad.  Copy the files in the "extensions" directory to
  get started.

# Added URL protocol handler for wikidPad so that wiki urls will open
  wikidpad. For example:
       
  wiki://C|/Program%20Files/WikidPad/WikidPadHelp/data/ChangeLog.wiki
       
       Will open up this page in a new instance of wikidPad.  This will work
       outside of wikidPad as well, from Internet Explorer for example.  The
       easiest way to create a link to another wiki from within a wiki page
       is to just drag and drop the .wiki file onto the text editor.
       
# Fixed some issues with the html export.  Specifically bulleted list
       problems.  Also, ignore blocks << >> weren't exported properly.

# If wikidPad is closed when minimized don't remember the minimized sizes.
# Highlighted text is only evaluated when Ctrl-E is pressed now, not Ctrl-1-6.
       This lets me implement this example InlinePythonEval#encodeSelection.

# Fixed a bug with todo lists under Views. Actual todo list items weren't
       displayed, only the todo list categories were.
# Added support passing the wiki word to open on the command line.
        wikidpad.exe wikiroot.wiki wikiword        
       You can also pass in the name of a wiki word file and wikidpad will
       open the wiki for that word and then open the word.
        wikidpad.exe path_to_wiki_word_file.wiki
       This also means that you can now double click on a wiki word file
       and wikidpad will open the wiki for the word, and then open the word.

       the beginning.

# Added support for WIKIDPADWords that have multiple capital letters in
       the beginning followed by lower case letters.
# Added support for links [That Arent Wiki Words]
# Moved the code triggered by Ctrl-B, Ctrl-I and Ctrl-Alt-H into
       keybindings.py.  Now if you change the regex for bold or italic you
       can also customize the code triggered by the keyboard command and the
       menu option.
# In some situations wikidPad might appear off screen at startup.
  Added a check for this and code to reposition wikidPad back on screen.

# urls that end in .gif, .jpg, or .png will be exported as <IMG> tags
  when exporting to HTML.
# Tree node text is not limited to 20 characters anymore.  The text
  used to be chopped at 20, and ... would be appended to the end.
# Words with nested underscores ARE_NOT_TREATED_AS_ITALICS.
# ~TurnsOffWordLinking.  ~ will cause a word to not be treated as a
  wiki word link.

# You can now have more than 1 link on a line.
        http://www.google.com/ http://www.yahoo.com/
# Added "tree_position" attribute.  Look at the bottom of this page.
  You can now change the order of the tree nodes by assigning a
  "tree_position" or a "priority" to a node.  This page has a
  tree_position of 0, so it is at the top of the tree to the left.
# Clicking on a todo in the "Views" node will now highlight the todo
  item in the document.
# Added support for script imports.  This allows you to define a set
  of scripts in a GlobalScriptLibrary and then import them.
       
  [import_scripts: GlobalScriptLibrary]
       
  Type "Ctrl-4" to execute script 4 from the library.

       todos properly.  Script blocks with wiki words, and urls with wiki
       words in them are also now suppressed.

       file.

# TodoItem markers (todo, action) are now case-sensitive to avoid marking
       TodoWikiWords as todos.
# Added ability to suppress TextFormatting. Example:
            << *This should be bold* ThisShouldBeALink >>
# Added "Insert Date" command to "Editor" menu.
# Added support for custom InlinePythonEval functions assigned to
       Ctrl-1-4. For example, type Ctrl-1 to execute the function below.
       
       <% 1: editor.AddText("hi") %>
