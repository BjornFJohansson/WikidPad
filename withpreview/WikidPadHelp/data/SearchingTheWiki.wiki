++ Searching The Wiki

CTRL-R brings up the "Find and Replace" dialog.
CTRL-F or F3 turns on wiki page IncrementalSearch.
CTRL-ALT-F brings up the search dialog for the entire wiki.

When searching the entire wiki you can use regex searches, along with
"and" predicates. For example, to search this wiki for pages with "search"
and "wiki" in them type:

CTRL-ALT-F
search and wiki
Press Search Button

To search for "(search or java)" and "wiki" type

CTRL-ALT-F
(search|java) and wiki
Press Search Button

To search for special characters like "[" or "(" you must escape them
with a back slash. "\[". This is b/c these characters are special to the
regex engine.

*Saving Searches*

In the "Search Wiki" dialog there is an option to "Save Search". This
option will save your search as a view.  You can then find and execute
that search by expanding the "Views/searches" node of the tree.  This
is a powerful way to create dynamic search based views of your data. 

You can delete saved searches by selecting "View Saved Searches" from
the Wiki menu, selecting the search phrase you would like to delete,
and clicking the Delete button.
