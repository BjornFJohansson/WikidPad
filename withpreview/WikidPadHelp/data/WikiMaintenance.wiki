++ Wiki Maintenance

As you add and remove links from the various pages in your wiki
database you may end up with unlinked, or parentless, nodes.  To view
parentless nodes select:

Wiki Word/View Parentless Nodes
or press Ctrl-Shift-Up

You can then decide if you need to relink these nodes, or if you want
to delete them via the CTRL-D delete command.
