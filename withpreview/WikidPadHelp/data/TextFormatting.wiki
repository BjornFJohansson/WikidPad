++ Text Formatting

As you type you can enter formatting commands in plain text.

*bold*
_italic_

+ Heading1

++ Heading2

+++ Heading3

When you type in a really really really really really really really really really really really really
long line you can tell wikidPad to rewrap it for you by pressing Ctrl-W. Try it on this line.

You can even change the wrap position by adding a wrap attribute to your document.
[wrap: 20]
Changes the wrapping on this page to 20.

[global.wrap: 70]
changes the global wrap position to 70.

*Escaping Formatting*

To create a section of text with no formatting, wrap that section 
in a "<<>>" block. Example:

without formatting

<<
*This should be bold* ThisShouldBeALink
>> 

with formatting

*This should be bold* ThisShouldBeALink
