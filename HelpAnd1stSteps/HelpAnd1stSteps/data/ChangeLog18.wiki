    * The order how wiki pages are ordered when printing or

      is (hopefully) more logical. It is the same as the new
      "As Tree" order used in PageListDialog#"As# Tree" .
    * Option to generate a table of contents in tree or list form
      for HTML exports, see WikiExport#*Additional# options* ,

+++ 1.8 beta 1
Aug. 30, 2006 (1.8beta1, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 89)

<<
Changes:
    * New database format! After updating a wiki it won't be
      readable anymore for older versions of WikidPad.
    * Updating of wiki databases to new versions is now done only
      after asking user.
    * New position for configuration files on Windows inside
      "Application Data\WikidPad" directory. You might have to move
      "WikidPad.config" file and ".WikidPadGlobals" directory from
      "Application Data" to the new location if updating from
      a previous version. Name of "Application Data" directory
      depends on OS language.
    
    * Cursor and scroll position are now saved between sessions.
    * Possibility to set size and alignment for image URLs.
      See UrlLinking#++# URL# Appendix
    * Functional pages for "camelcase blacklist". Words on this
      list are not shown as wiki links. See WordLinking
    * Option to automatically remove bullets and numbers which
      stand "lonely" on a line by pressing enter.
      See BulletedLists
    
    * Menu functions "Show Tree Control", "Show Toolbar" and
      "Stay on Top" moved to "View" menu
    * Preview now shows indented paragraphs correctly (or,
      at least, better)
    
    * Bug fixed: Wiki word aliases not shown as links on
      HTML export.
    * Bug fixed: Wrong URL creation mode when releasing/pressing
      SHIFT or CTRL during drag&drop operation.
    * Better handling of non Western-European languages on
      Win 98/ME
