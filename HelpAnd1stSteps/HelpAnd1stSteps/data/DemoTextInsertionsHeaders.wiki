+++ Remarks
    * The \[:toc:] in the inserting page is not updated for headers in the inserted text; nór in preview nór in html export
    * The \[:rel:] link insertions áre updated for the inserting page
    * You cannot create "Top" links using regular anchor references, since these need the name of the page they are on; the inserting page in this case[1].


[:rel:top]

Footnotes:
[1] _You can create "Top" links for "insert pages", by using html tags with an empty anchor name; like this: <a href="#">Top</a>. Anchors with empty names default to "Top of page". Attention: this does not work in the internal preview renderer._

+++ Todo's
done.demo.projectdemo.demo2: Check out all posibilities
action.demo.projectdemo.demo2: check with development about headers in inserted pages and the TOC of the inserting page.
This must always be a matter of choice for the user, since inserted headers must fit the structure of those of the inserting page and they will not allways be able to do that. This would take a syntax change; the addition of a "yes/no TOC update" to the \[:page:name] insertion.
question.demo.development: is it possible to create a \[:rel:top] link "insertion" | that would work no matter whether it would come from a template, an inserted page or the page itself. Create an anchor on the very top of every page, that allways has the same name - does not differ per page. An anchor like: \<a name=".h-1"></a>. And allways translate \[:rel:top] to: \<a href="#.h-1">Top</a>. This sollution should also work in internal preview.
