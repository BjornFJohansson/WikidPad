+++ Remarks
    * Within font style tags an insertion is not recognised as such, so you cannot turn a to be inserted text to bold, italic or otherwise from within the inserting page.
    * Lists allow the insertion of a page; whatever is inserted however, counts as an addition to the line the insertion is on. The whole page counts at them most as 1 bullet.
    * If the page contains a bulleted list, that list becomes part of the bulleted list of the inserting page [2], but only if the lists are of the same type. If not, the inserting list is broken.
    * If the inserted page contains a reference to a footnote, that reference will in preview refer to a footnote of the inserting page, with the same number. If the inserted page has it's own footnote, then that footnote will become a reference to the inserting page's footnote. [3]
    * If the inserting page does not have a footnote with the same number, then neither the inserted page's footnote reference, not it's footnote will be recognised as such anymore. [3]
    * An escape block correctly does not process an insertion.
    * A preformatted block correctly does not process an insertion.[1]
    * A table can contain insertions.

[1] _According to the specifications, a preformatted block is an escape block, that shows it's content in a monospaces font style._
[2] _This is not handled correctly and causes lines with empty bullets to appear in the list. This will be corrected in an upcomming version of WikidPad._
[3] _The incorrect handling of insertions with footnotes will be corrected in an upcomming version of WikidPad._
[10] _This footnote is to test the insertion with the footnote_
