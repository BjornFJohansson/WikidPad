++ Quotation Characters
[:rel:back]
----
Attributes and insertions consist of a key/value pair, whereby the value sometimes can have additional parameters; this is specifically the case for insertions. The value/parameter part might - specifically for plugins - have to contain characters, that are not normally allowed within the syntax. To support this, WikidPad allows for quotation of a value or parameter or both.

A quotation symbol is an arbitrary number of one of the quotation characters ", ', / or \ (double quotation mark, single quotation mark, slash or backslash). The starting and ending symbols must be the same. Examples of quotation symbols are:

	* "
	* '''
	* //
	* /////
	* \\

The attribute \[manufacturer: Levi & Strauss] can therefore be written as:

<<
[manufacturer: "Levi & Strauss"]
[manufacturer: '''Levi & Strauss''']
[manufacturer: //Levi & Strauss//]
[manufacturer: /////Levi & Strauss/////]
[manufacturer: \\Levi & Strauss\\]
>>
