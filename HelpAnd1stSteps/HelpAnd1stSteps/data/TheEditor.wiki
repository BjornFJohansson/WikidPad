	* select: drag and drop [2]
	* multiple undo, redo
	* [LineNumbers |line numbering]
	* [Folding |folding]
	* [SpellChecking |spell checking] [3]
Furthermore it suports a number of specialised functions, like:
	* [TextFormatting |(html) text formatting]
	* dragging and dropping of [Using the treeview |page links] and [LinksUrl |url links]
	* converting selected text into [Using replace text by wikiword |wiki pages]
	* selection and insertion of icon and color [SignalPageNodes |page attributes]
	* [ImagePasting |pasting of images] from the clipboard.
Also a number of functions are implemented to make life easier, like:
	* insertion of standard texts with [TextBlocks |Text blocks]

+++ Auto save
WikidPad tries to save the document in the editor window for you often. This "auto save" occurs:
    1. after about 5-15 seconds of idle time.
    2. on navigation to a new wiki page.
    3. on shutdown.
A page can be saved manually by pressing Ctrl-S.

----
[1] _When copying from external sources like web pages, wikidpad will only paste the text, nót the formatting tags._
[2] _The default drag and drop performs a "cut and paste" of the selected text; a "copy and paste" can be performed by holding the Ctrl key when dropping._
[3] _Spell checking is optional and needs a plugin to be installed._
