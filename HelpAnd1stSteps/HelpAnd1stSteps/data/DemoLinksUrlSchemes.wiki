----
A scheme consists of the following elements:[1]
    * scheme://host.domain:port/path/filename
Wherein:
    * Scheme is defining the type of Internet service. The most common type is http.
    * Domain is defining the Internet domain name like w3schools.com.
    * Host is defining the domain host. If omitted, the default host for http is www.
    * Port is defining the port number at the host. The port number is normally omitted. The default port number for http is 80.
    * Path is defining a path (a sub directory) at the server. If the path is omitted, the resource (the document) must be located at the root directory of the Web site.
    * Filename is defining the name of a document. The default filename might be default.asp, or index.html or something else depending on the settings of the Web server.

Some examples of the most common schemes are:
    <<|
