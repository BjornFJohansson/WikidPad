Same as before, but set reaction if CTRL is pressed while clicking the middle button.

When double clicking into preview (not on a link), this can either do nothing, switch the tab to editor or open a new tab with same page, but in editor mode.

&bull; *Middle click on tab*
This can either do nothing or close the tab
