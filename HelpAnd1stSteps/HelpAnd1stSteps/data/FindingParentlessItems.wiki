+++ General
As you add and remove links from the various pages in your wiki database you may end up with unlinked, or parentless pages. To view parentless pages either:
	* select "Wiki Word / View Parentless Nodes" from the main menu.
	* press Ctrl-Shift-Up
	* go to the node "parentless-nodes" in the views tree

You can then decide if you need to relink these nodes or if you want to delete them via the Ctrl-D delete command.
