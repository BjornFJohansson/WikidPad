+++ General
Full search provides an extended search facility for wiki wide searches. To start the full search dialog either:
	* press Ctrl-Alt-F
	* select Wiki / "Search Wiki" from the main menu
The search dialog is non-modal, this means that you can move between pages and edit them while the dialog is open. The right side of the dialog shows the search results, the left side contains the options to control the search. Full search supports a "find & replace" mode.

*Attention* Full search operates on the data in the database. If there is a page in the editor that is not yet saved, then those changes can't be seen by the search dialog.

+++ The result list
Each item in the result list consist of the page name, one or two optional numbers in parentheses behind the name (one number: Number of occurrences, two numbers: currently shown occurrence, then "/", then number of occurrences or a question mark if unknown)

In the result list, double clicking on an item (not on its blue bar!) brings you to the page and (if existing) to the matching occurrence shown for the list item. If the page was already loaded, a double click brings you to the next occurrence on this page.

If a particular occurrence is shown in the list, you can select this item and press F3 or click on the little blue bar on the left to show the next occurrence on this page.
