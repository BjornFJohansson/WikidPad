++ Hooks
[:rel:back]
----
In the [ProgramFiles |WikidPad / extensions] directory, the file "wikidpadhooks.py" is located. If you have working knowledge of Python you can extend wikidPad by hooking into the events sent to the methods defined in this file. You could for example integrate wikidPad with cvs, by plugging into the events: onopen, onsave, ondelete and onrename.

To do so, copy the existing file: 
	* [ProgramFiles |wikidpad / extensions / wikidpadhooks.py] to 
	* [ProgramFiles |wikidpad / user_extensions / wikidpadhooks.py];
create the directory if it doesn't exist.
Then edit [ProgramFiles |user_extensions / wikidpadhooks.py] with a standard text editor to hook into the events. This file will not be touched when upgrading wikidPad.
