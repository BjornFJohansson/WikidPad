++ Hooks
[:rel:back]
----
Under the wikidPad install directory:

file:///C|/WikidPad/program%20Files/WikidPad by default

There is a directory called "extensions".  In this folder there is a
file called "wikidpadhooks.py". If you know Python you can extend
wikidPad by hooking into the events sent to the methods defined
in this file. For example, you could integrate wikidPad with cvs
by plugging into the onopen, onsave, ondelete, onrename events.
