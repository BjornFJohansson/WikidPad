+++ General
Insertions allow to insert some dynamic text into preview and HTML export of a page. This can either be:
	* the text of a different page.
	* one or more links to anchors or pages.
	* the result of a python evaluation.
	* the result of a structure graph.
	* the result of a call to a plugin.

++++ Syntax
The syntax greatly resembles that of [WpAttributes |attributes], with one extra colon ":" in front of the key. To insert, for example, the content of the page: GlobalAttributesPageMisc, use the page insertion: \[:page:\GlobalAttributesPageMisc], giving:

	[:page:GlobalAttributesPageMisc]

In preview this will result in the insertion being replaced with a text on the global attribute: "view_pane".

Attribute values can be enclosed in [QuotationCharacters |quotation characters] to allow them to contain reserved characters. This is particularly applicable to eval and plugin insertions.

++++ Types of insertions
There are different types of insertions, that are all described on their own pages:
	* [TextInsertions |Page insertions]
	* [Link insertions |Link insertions]
	* [StructureGraphs |Structure graph insertions]
	* [ExternalGraphicalApplications |Plugin insertions]
	* [Scripts |Eval insertions]
