++ Intro 7: Searching
[:rel:back]
----
+++ General 
Next to all the possibilities to link, index and navigate the wiki pages, WikidPad supports extensive search facilities. These range from local page searching, like:
	* [IncrementalSearch |incremental search] and
	* [FindReplace |find & replace]
to wiki wide searching, like:
	* [FastSearch |fast search] and
	* [FullSearch |full search].
All these functions support [RegEx |regular expressions] to specify search patterns.

Full search is the most extensive one; it additionally offers the facility to save the specifications of a search in the wiki "search store" for later reuse and optionally it can be used to do a wiki wide "find & replace".
It also offers the facility to limit the search to a subset of a wiki's pages; a subset that can be specified using the [PageListDialog |page list dialog]. This dialog supports regular expressions, but also allows to create a pagelist (i.e. page subset) manually. The dialog is also available in a number of output dialogs, like [ItemPrinting |printing], [ItemPublishing |html publishing] and [Wiki export |export], to specify the pages to be processed.
