+++ General
WikidPad at all times knows what the "relatives" of the current page are; it's parents and/or it's children. This function can be used to quickly navigate to a specific parent or child.

	----
++++ Parents
To view the parents of the current page:
	* press Ctrl-Up
	* select "Wiki Words / List Parents" from the main menu
This will bring up the relatives dialog showing a list of the parent(s), like in the screenshot below.

The dialog can be used to jump to one of the listed pages by either:
	* navigating to it's link in the list using the cursor keys and pressing Enter
	* selecting it with the mouse and clicking OK or "Open in ... New Tab"
	* double clicking it with the mouse

	----
++++ Children
To view the children of the current page:
	* press Ctrl-Down
	* select "Wiki Words / List Children" from the main menu
This will bring up the relatives dialog showing the list of children. Navigating to one of the children is done the same way as for navigating to a parent.
