+++ General
The files of a wiki are stored in subdirectory of a directory of your choice. Each wiki has it's own directory with a number of subdirectories. By default the directory has the name of the wiki and mostly it's the same name as that of the (original) root page.

+++ Wiki directory
A wiki directory contains a wiki configuration file with the name of the wiki and a ".wiki" extention and subdirectories like:
	* "data" for the wiki database and other wiki data
	* "file" to support the [FilesWikiFileStore |wiki file store] (optional)

rel://files/NewWikiExample1.png rel://files/NewWikiExample2.png

Furthermore it can contain additional subdirectories of your own choice, like one or more to store the results of [ItemPublishing |html] or other [Wiki export |exports].
