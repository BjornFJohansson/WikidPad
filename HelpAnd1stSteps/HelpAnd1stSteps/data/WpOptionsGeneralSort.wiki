&bull; *Sort order*
Sets the alphabetical sort algorithm for the nodes in the [TheTreeView |Main tree] and for the PageListDialog.
The possible choices are:
	* Default: sorts according to default sort order determined by the operating system.
		* Upper case first: sorts \ABCabc instead of \AaBbCc.
	* C: The original WikidPad sort order: uppercase first, non-English characters in illogical order at the end
