++ Finding Undefined Items

+++ General
There may be wiki links to pages that do not exist, e. g. UndefinedPage. These are underlined and black in the editor. To list all such links, use the "undefined-nodes" node in the "Views" tree. If you click on one of these links you go to an empty page for this word and can fill it with content.

Sometimes words are unintentionally marked as wiki words. In this case you can either:
    * Prefix the word with a backslash
    * Add the attribute \[camelCaseWordsEnabled: false] on a page
    * Enter the word into one of the blacklists, see [Using WikiWords |Page linking: using wikiwords].
