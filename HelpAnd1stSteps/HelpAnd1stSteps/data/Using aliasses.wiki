+++ General
Different page links - wikiwords and/or bracketed links - can be appointed to refer to the same physical page. This can be done by adding the page attribute "alias" to an existing page. An alias attribute has the form: \[alias: \<link>], where \<link> is the page link, that the page should be known as also. As many aliasses can be added to a page, as is needed.

An example is the item WikiWords, that is also known under the aliasses: WikiWord, [Wiki word], [Wiki words] and [What is a wikiword]. The alias attributes of that item look like this:
<<pre
[alias:WikiWord]
[alias:Wiki Word]
[alias:Wiki word]
[alias:Wiki Words]
[alias:Wiki words]
[alias:What is a wikiword]
>>

The aliasses could also have been written as 1 attribute, like this:
<<pre
[alias: WikiWord; Wiki Word; Wiki word; Wiki Words; Wiki words; What is a wikiword]
>>
