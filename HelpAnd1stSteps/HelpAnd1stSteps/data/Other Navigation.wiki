+++ General
This page lists navigation functions that don't fit in one of the other categories.

	----
++++ Home
This function jumps to the wiki's root page and makes that the current page of the current tab. You can execute the function by either:
	* pressing Ctrl-Q
	* clicking the rel://files/tb_home.gif button on the toolbar
	* selecting History / "Wiki Home" from the main menu

	----
++++ Open page
You can go/jump straight to any page in the wiki with the "open page" function. To use it:
	* press Ctrl-O
This will open the "Open page" dialog window, like in the screenshot below:

	rel://files/OpenPageExample1.png

Start typing the first characters of the page name you are looking for in the inputfield and WikidPad will show a list of all the page names that start with those characters. If the page you are looking for is in the list, you can go there by either:
	* navigating to it's link in the list using the cursor keys and pressing Enter
	* selecting it with the mouse and clicking OK
	* double clicking it with the mouse
If the page you are looking for doesn't (yet) exist in the wiki, the dialog allows you to create a new page. This will however become a parentless page, since WikidPad will not automatically add the new page's link to the current page.

You can also choose to:
	* open the page in a new tab and making that the current tab
	* open the page in a new tab without making it the current tab
