&bull; *Ignore wiki lock file*
(Default: off) When checked, a wiki is opened without warning even if a lock file is already present.

&bull; *Create wiki lock file*
(Default: on) When not checked, no lock file is created when opening a wiki (and it isn't deleted when closing it). This setting does not affect the behavior of the wikis already opened.
