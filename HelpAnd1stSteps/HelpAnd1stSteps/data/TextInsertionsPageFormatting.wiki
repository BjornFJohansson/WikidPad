    * HTML Cross-browser color names - like: \DarkSlateBlue - don't work here
    * colors have to specified with their #Hex HTML color number, like:
        * #000000 for Black
        * #483D8B for \DarkSlateBlue
    * linkcolor, textcolor and bgcolor also work in preview, the others don't
    * Can be set for the whole Wiki by adding the "global." attribute

+++ Remarks
    * Html attributes on the inserted page have no influence on the inserting page[1].
    * The paragraph_mode attribute has no influence on the inserting page[1].
    * The font attribute has no influence on the inserting page, which is correct, since it only influences the editor[2].
    * The wrap attribute has no influence on the inserting page, which is correct, since it only influences the editor[2][3].
    * The camelCaseWordsEnabled attribute has no influence on the inserting page, which is correct, since it only influences the editor[2].

[1] _This is the case for both Preview ánd HTML Export._
[2] _During editing the page is not yet inserted yet, so this couldn't work anyway._
[3] _The wrap attribute only forms an input for the Rewrap function (Ctrl+W)._
