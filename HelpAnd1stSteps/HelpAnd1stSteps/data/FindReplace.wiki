+++ General
The WikidPad editor provides a find & replace facility for individual pages; it is a reasonably standard facility, like also word processors and other editors provide.

To start the find & replace dialog:
	* press Ctrl-R
	* select Editor / "Find and replace" from the main menu

A particular detail is that it supports [RegEx |regular expressions] in the search field, but it doesn't do so by default. You have to check the "Regular expression" checkbox, to make it interprate the search criterion as a regex. In this mode you can use regex "escape sequences" in both the search and the replace pattern.
