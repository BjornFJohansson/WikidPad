	*Application settings: User interface*
	----
&bull; *Minimize to Tray*
Minimized to system tray instead of the normal taskbar.

&bull; *Minimize on close button*
Pressing the close button on the main frame (the little "X") does not close but minimize WikidPad. In conjunction with "Minimize to Tray" it minmizes to the try area.

If you really want to close, use menu "Wiki"->"Exit" then or the context menu when right-clicking on the tray icon (if "Minimize to Tray" is active).

&bull; *Statusbar time format*
Set the time format the statusbar should use to show modification and creation date of the current wiki page. The format can also be set by clicking on the small "..." button which starts the same dialog as used for setting the date format for the editor.

&bull; *UI language*
Choose the preferred language of the user interface.
This setting only takes effect after restarting WikidPad.
