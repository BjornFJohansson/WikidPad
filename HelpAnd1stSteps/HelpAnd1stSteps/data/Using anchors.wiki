++ Using anchors
Contents:   [:toc:]
[:rel:back]
----
+++ General
Links can not only be created to refer to a specific page, but they can also expanded, to refer to a specific position within the text of that page. Like this [AnchorExample|item5]!item5 link, that will jump to item 5 of an example text and [AnchorExample|item2]!item2, that will jump to item&nbsp;2.

The place in the item-text to jump to, is defined with an "anchor" attribute; this attribute has the format: "anchor:anchor-name". It has to be on it's own on an otherwise empty line, in front of the text to jump to.

To have a link refer to an anchor, use the link for the page it is on, followed by an exclamation mark and the name of the anchor, like: wikiword!anchor-name, \[link]!anchor-name or \[link |title]!anchor-name.

anchor:samePage
+++ Anchors on the same page
Links to anchors do not default to the current page. So "!samePage" will not create a link to the anchor at the beginning of this section. References to anchors only work in connection with a link; even if that is a link tot the current page itself. So in order to create a link to the anchor of this section, the format should be: \[Using anchors]!samePage.

[:rel:top]
----
+++ Syntax
Anchors are case sensitive; "!Here" is a different anchor from "!here".
