+++ General
In the editor the current page (link) can be renamed by selecting the option: menu / \WikiWords / Rename or pressing Ctrl-Alt-R. This also works in the page tree, where also the "Rename" option from the page's context menu - right click - can be used.

Wikidpad will ask to enter a new name for the page (link) en then asks whether it should search the entire wiki for references to the page and rename those also.

If the title of the to be renamed page has not been modified since the creation of the page, i.e. the page still has the title as it was originally generated by Wikidpad, then the title will also be modified according to the new (link) name of the page.

+++ Caution: Changing the whole wiki
When the option "change all references to the page in the wiki" has been chosen, then for a large wiki this could be a relatively slow operation. Furthermore it does not function reliably, sometimes it modifies phrases that aren't intended as links. Therefore it is often better to adjust references on other pages manually afterward. The wiki-wide search and replace function might come in handy here.

+++ Caution: Renaming the root page
When the original root page of a wiki - the one with the same name as the wiki - is renamed, then the entire wiki is renamed, inclusing it's directories and files. This is correct behaviour, but be aware that this happens and be carefull using it.
