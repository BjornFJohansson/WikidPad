++ Demo Page View Attributes
Contents:   [:toc:]

----
+++ General
A number of attributes is available, that control the format of a page in the view modes: html preview and html export. These are the html- and other attributes. Changes in these attributes don't take effect (are not visible), until the page is saved; either by the auto-save process or manually.

+++ Html attributes
Html attributes are used to set the foreground- (font), background- and link colors of a page in Preview and exported Html and have the format: \[html.element: value]. The existing elements are:

<<|
*Element* |  *Function* |  | *Preview* |  | *Browser*
&nbsp;|&nbsp;| *Internal* | *IE* | *Mozilla* |&nbsp;
html.textcolor | Color of all non-link text | Yes | Yes | ??  | Yes
html.bgcolor | Color of the page background |  Yes | Yes | ??  | Yes
html.linkcolor | Color of a (non-visited) link |  Yes | Yes | ??  | Yes
html.alinkcolor | Color of a link while "under" the mouse (hovering or pressed) | No | Yes* | ?? | Some
html.vlinkcolor | Color of a visited link | No | Yes* | ?? | Yes
html.bgimage | Link to a background image | No | Yes* | ?? | No?
>>

*Remarks*
	* Colors have to be specified with their full 6 digit #hex html color number, like: #000000 for Black and #483D8B for \DarkSlateBlue.
	* Cross-browser color names like: \DarkSlateBlue are not accepted.
	* The 3 digit alternatives for certain colors, like #FFD as a synonym for #FFFFDD, are also not accepted.
	* For a complete list of html color numbers see: [http://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_colors.asp |W3 Schools: Colors] and [http://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_colorsfull.asp |W3 Schools: Color values]
	* Alinkcolor works in IE, but only for external web links, not for internal wikidpad page links and only for mouse pressed, not for mouse hovering.
	* Vlinkcolor works in IE, but only for external web links, and wikidpad anchors on the same page.
	* Bgimage works in IE, but it's use is rather limited, since:
		* The path (url) to the image may not contain any %20 or sortlike "characters". This also applies to relative paths (\rel://) since for preview these are converted by Wikidpad into absolute paths.
		* There are no (sub)attributes available to specify placement, positioning, repeating, etc. The image is repeated (tiled) over the entire page.
	* The attributes are called html attributes, since they only work in the html representations of a page and to distinct them from the options with which the colors for text, links, font, etc. in the editor window can be set. See options: menu / Wiki / Options / "Editor colors".

++++ Example
See the results of the attributes below on the appearance of this page in preview.
	* [html.bgcolor: #FFFFCC] \yellowish
	* [html.textcolor: #3300CC] \blueish
	* [html.linkcolor: #8B008B] \DarkMagenta
	* [html.alinkcolor: #FF4500] \OrangeRed
	* [html.vlinkcolor: #008000] \Green
	* \[html.bgimage:\rel:///notepad.png] (deactivated)
Check their influence on the display of these links; follow them and return to see their color.

++++ Global
All html attributes have global representations, with which the colors for áll of the pages in the wiki can be set:

	* \[global.html.bgcolor: color number]
	* \[global.html.textcolor: color number]
	* \[global.html.linkcolor: color number]
	* \[global.html.alinkcolor color number]
	* \[global.html.vlinkcolor: color number]
	* \[global.html.bgimage: url]

Page specific html attributes overrule the global ones.

+++ Paragraph mode
A page by default is in line mode. In this mode, every "new line" in the editor text is replaced by a htlm "new line" tag in preview and with this turning every line in a "paragraph" of it's own. This might in certain cases not be what the user wants or needs. Also this behaviour is different from html, that principally is based on a form of "paragraph mode".

Wikidpad supports it's own form of paragraph mode; in this mode "new lines" are ignored and only empty lines start a new paragraph. Paragraph mode can be switched on using the attribute: \[paragraph_mode:&nbsp;true] on the page. "New lines" can be forced in paragraph mode, by inserting the html "new line" tag: "\<br /\>" where needed.

	----
++++ Example
The attribute on the next line switches this page to paragraph mode; see it's effect on the example text below.
	* [paragraph_mode: true]

*Example text*<br />
In the editor this paragraph
is shown, devided over five (5) lines.
In preview and html export however,
this paragraph is shown as
one contiguous (wrapping) line.

In line mode, the text above
would have been shown in view mode
as the original five separate lines.<br />
And this line would have been a paragraph on it's own, not the second line of the second paragraph.

	----
++++ Global
Paragraph mode can be switched on for all the pages in the wiki using the global attribute:
	* \[global.paragraph_mode: true]
In that case it can be switched off for individual pages using:
	* \[paragraph_mode: false]

+++ Remarks
    * html.bgimage does not work when image url contains %20 or sortlike "characters". This is a known limitation.
