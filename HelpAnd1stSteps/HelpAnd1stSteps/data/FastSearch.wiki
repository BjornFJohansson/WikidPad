+++ General
Fast search operates wiki wide and is driven by the search field in the WikidPad toolbar. To use it:
	1. click with the mouse in the field
	2. type the [RegEx |regular expression] to search for
	3. press enter
The result is a dropped down list of pages where a match is found. The specification and layout of this list are exactly the same as that for the result list of the [FullSearch |Full search].
