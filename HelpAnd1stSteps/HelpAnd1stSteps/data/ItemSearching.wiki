WikidPad offers several powerfull facilities to search either the current page or the whole wiki. The facilities to search a page in preview are not equal to those of the editor.

    1. Search current page
        * Preview: [FindDialog |Find dialog] [1]
        * Editor: [IncrementalSearch |Incremental search]
        * Editor: [FindReplace |Find & Replace] dialog.
    2. Search whole wiki.
        * [FastSearch |Fast search] in the toolbar
        * [FullSearch |Full search] dialog

[1] _The find dialog that is started depends on the used preview renderer: internal or external._
