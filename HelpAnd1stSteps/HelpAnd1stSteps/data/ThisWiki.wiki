+++ Help version 0.3
This is version 0.3 of the help.wiki; a restructured, rewritten and extended version of the old wikidpadhelp.wiki. Part of this wiki is still under construction, but it dóes already contain the complete content of wikidpadhelp úp and including version 1.9 beta 18.5.
The wiki has been designed with IE as the [ThePreview |preview renderer]; it might not look ideal in the internal preview renderer here and there.

+++ WikidPad version
This wiki utilises the "link insertions":
	* \[:rel:back]
	* \[:rel:top]
and the "link insertion" parameter:
	* "aslist"
that are only available in version 1.9 beta 18.5 and higher.
The wiki cán however be used with earlier versions, without any problems.

+++ Tree icons
This wiki uses a small number of icons, that are not yet available in WikidPad's default set. These icons are:

	* rel://icons/wp_home.gif : wp_home
	* rel://icons/wp_settings.gif : wp_settings
	* rel://icons/wp_template.gif : wp_template
	* rel://icons/bullet%20red.gif : bullet red
	* rel://icons/flag%20red.gif : flag red

They can be found in the "icons" folder of this wiki and can be made available by copying them into the "icons" subfolder of your WikidPad program folder. In the various screenshots in this wiki you will see examples of other icons, that aren't in the current WikidPad icon set. They will however become available in the upcoming version (2.0) of WikidPad. In the mean time they might at some point become available as an extra download on the wikidpad website. So keep checking if you like the screenshots. Be aware however that a lot of the old icons won't be in there anymore.
