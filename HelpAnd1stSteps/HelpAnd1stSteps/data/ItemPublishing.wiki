+++ General
WikidPad can publish wiki pages to html pages that can be viewed with standard browsers like IE, Firefox and Opera. Publishing can be done to a single html page or a set of html pages or one wiki page at a time.

To publish all or part of a wiki you can select predefined "Wiki / Export" functions from the main menu:
	* Export Wiki As Single Html Page
	* Export Wiki As Set of Html Pages
	* Export Current Wiki Word As Html Page
	* Export Sub-tree As Single Html Page
	* Export Sub-tree As Set of Html Pages
These functions use the default settings as described below in "Settings". To override these settings or specify a different page collection, select "Other export ..." from the menu. This will bring up the export dialog window.

+++ The dialog window
Publishing pages to html is at this moment combined with "DataExchange" into one integral export function. Both functions use the same dialog window. The options relevant to html publishing are:

&bull; *What to export*
Specifies what you want to publish; the possible choices are:
	* All pages in the wiki.
	* All pages in the current subtree (the current page and it's children).
	* The current page only.
	* A subset of all the wiki pages.
For a subset of the pages choose "Custom"; this will bring up the [PageListDialog] where the subset can be defined.

&bull; *Export to*
Controls to whát the pages should be published; the possible choices are:
	* one single html page for the whole wiki (i.e. one .htm file)
	* one html page per wiki page (i.e. one .htm file per wiki page).

&bull; *Compatible filenames*
Controls whether to use ASCII-only filenames for the html files so that they can be transferred to other filesystems without compatibility issues.

	On Windows XP and Server 2003 the \AppLocale utility might also help on export problems (see http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/apploc.mspx).

&bull; *Shows pics as links in export*
Overrides the default application setting; see "Settings" below.

&bull; *Table of contents*
Overrides the default application setting; see "Settings" below.

&bull; *Destination file/directory*
Specify the folder where the generated html files should be stored. Overrides the default wiki setting; see "Settings" below.

	All files in the [FilesWikiFileStore |File Store] that are referenced by a relative URL (URL beginning with "rel://") in the pages to be exported are copied to a "files" directory in the destination directory. This also applies to files in subdirectories of the "files" directory.
