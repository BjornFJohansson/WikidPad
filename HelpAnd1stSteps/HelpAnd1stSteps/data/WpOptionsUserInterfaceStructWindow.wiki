	*Application settings: User interface, structure window*
	----
&bull; *Structure window pos.*
Where (relative to main window) should the window be positioned? "Hidden" deactivates it.
*KNOWN BUG*: After changing the position of the window, restarting WikidPad is necessary. See WorkSpaceGeneral!RestartWikidPad for details.

&bull; *Structure window depth*
Up to (and including) which heading level should headings be displayed? "1" Means only top-level heading (one plus sign), "15" means all headings.

&bull; *Auto-hide structure window*
After double-clicking an entry in the window it is collapsed (hidden) automatically if this setting is checked.
