----
+++ General
You can add links to images to your pages and have them shown in preview. You do this with a URL of the type file-url. These files can be of type: ".jpg", ".gif", ".png" and ".bmp". To insert image files as línks, see [LinksFiles|Files].

Example:
An image as an image rel://files/library64.png>at Original size (64x64)

[:rel:top]
----
+++ Sizing
Images can be resized but depending on the browser, the quality of the results can be questionable. It is better to resize the images beforehand in a good graphics program.

++++ Absolute size (in pixels)
Half size (32x32) rel://files/library64.png>s32x32

Streched size (64x32) rel://files/library64.png>s64x32

Enlarged size (80x80) rel://files/library64.png>s80x80

    ----
++++ Relative to surrounding page area
Tenth size (10%x10%) rel://files/library64.png>s10%x10%4

Streched size (20%x10%) rel://files/library64.png>s20%x10%

    ----
++++ Relative to image
Half size (50%) rel://files/library64.png>r50%

Tenth size (10%x10%) rel://files/library64.png>r10%x10%

Streched size (20%x10%) rel://files/library64.png>r20%x10%

[:rel:top]
----
+++ Alignment
*Important:* Internal preview does nót respect allingment parameters; it ignores them! The results of allignment can only be seen in an external renderer. Internal preview alligns "bottom" by default; this makes a page look different when shown in the internal renderer from when shown in an external renderer.

++++ Default
The alignment defaults to rel://files/library48.png inline, vertical Bottom (image has white space at the bottom)

    ----
++++ Vertical
This is aligned rel://files/library48.png>at vertical Top

This is aligned rel://files/library48.png>am vertical Middle

This is aligned rel://files/library48.png>ab vertical Bottom

    ----
++++ Horizontal
rel://files/library48.png>ar This is aligned horizontal Right
If there is text to the left of the link, the image drops a line in html
Moving any following text below the image, takes empty lines or \<br /> tags

rel://files/library48.png>al This is aligned horizontal Left
If there is text to the left of the link, the image drops a line in html<br /><br />
[:rel:top]
----
+++ Combined alignment and size
++++ Vertical
This is aligned rel://files/library48.png>at;r75% vertical Top; size 75%

This is aligned rel://files/library48.png>am;r125% vertical Middle; size 125%

This is aligned rel://files/library48.png>ab;r75% vertical Bottom; size 75%

    ----
++++ Horizontal
rel://files/library48.png>ar;r150% This is aligned horizontal Right; size 150%
If there is text to the left of the link, the image drops a line in html
Moving any following text below the image, takes empty lines or \<br /> tags

rel://files/library48.png>al;r125% This is aligned horizontal Left; size 125%
If there is text to the left of the link, the image drops a line in html<br /><br />

[:rel:top]
----
+++ Titles
++++ Text
Like with file and URL links, you can add a title to the image "link". Nothing is however done with this title. [1]

    ----
++++ Images    
It is possible to add an image as a title to the image; meaning that wikidpad does not complain about it. Nothing is however done with that image; it is not shown in preview, neither is it exported to html.

Images cán however with good reasons be used as "titles" for the other link types, like: [LinksWebsites|Websites], [LinksFiles|Files] and [LinksWikis|Wiki's]. See also: [LinksUrl|Url links], 

[:rel:top]
[1] _In an upcoming version of WikidPad the title text will be used as the image's "alt" text (\<img src="url" alt="title" /\>)_

+++ Remarks
    * Inserting images is restricted to the formats: ".jpg", ".gif", ".png" and ".bmp".
    * To insert an image, that does not have one of the default extentions, add the "i" attribute to the link. Example:rel://files/smile.smiley>i.
    * To use more then 1 attribute for an image, seperate them by a semicolon (" >i;at;r75% ").
    * Sizes are specified as Width x Hight.
    * There is no equivalent for align: horizontal Center for the simple reason, that it does not exist in html either.
    * Horizontal and vertical allignment can not be combined; html does not support this either. For horizontal alignment the "float" atribute is used; this alligns "Top" by default.
    * The alignment settings are *not* respected by the *internal preview* renderer!
    * The internal preview renderer alligns *Bottom* by default.
    * The difference in alignment makes a page look different when shown in the internal renderer, then when shown in an external renderer.
