+++ Change key bindings
Under the wikidPad install directory:

	* file:///C|/WikidPad/program%20Files/WikidPad by default

There is a directory called "extensions". In this directory there is a
file called keybindings.py. This file contains the variables used by
wikidPad to assign key bindings. Copy this file into a directory in
the wikidPad install directory called "user_extensions" (create it if
it doesn't exist). Edit this file to override the default key
bindings. This file will not be touched when upgrading wikidPad.

	* file:///C|/WikidPad/program%20Files/WikidPad/extensions/KeyBindings.py
	* file:///C|/WikidPad/program%20Files/WikidPad/user_extensions/KeyBindings.py

Please note that if you change this file you should keep a backup of it
outside of the wikidPad directory so that if/when you upgrade wikidPad
in the future you don't lose your key bindings.
