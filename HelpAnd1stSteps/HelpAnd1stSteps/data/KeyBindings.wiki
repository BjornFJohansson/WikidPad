+++ Change key bindings
The default key bindings can be overridden by creating a custom "keybindings.py" file. To do so, copy the existing file: 
	* [ProgramFiles |wikidpad / extensions / keybindings.py] to 
	* [ProgramFiles |wikidpad / user_extensions / keybindings.py];
create the directory if it doesn't exist.
Then edit [ProgramFiles |user_extensions / keybindings.py] with a standard text editor to override the default key bindings. This file will not be touched when upgrading wikidPad. Don't however touch the top line of the file, that looks like:
	* "import wx, wx.stc"

The general entry in the file is of the format:
	* \ShowTreeControl="Ctrl-T"
If you would rather use Alt+T for that function, then change the entry to
	* \ShowTreeControl="Alt-T"
Don't forget to save the file and [WorkSpaceGeneral |restart wikidpad]!RestartWikidPad to make use of your new keybindings.
