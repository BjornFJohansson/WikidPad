+++ General
Wikidpad does not store images in it's database; it retrieves them from disk in preview on a page by page basis, based on their url file link. This however does not mean that images - copied from a website for instance - can't be pasted into a page. Wikidpad dóes support this, but instead of storing it in it's own database, it will store in the [FilesWikiFileStore |file store] and create a relative link on the page, pointing to the file store. A number of options is available, to control this function.
