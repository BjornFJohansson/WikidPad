--- To run WikidPad from source ---

set PYTHONPATH=lib
python WikidPad.py

--- To build and generate executable ---

set PYTHONPATH=lib
build.bat

This will generate a "build" directory and a "dist" directory.

--- To create a WikidPad.exe distribution ---

Modify the version number of wikidPad in:

setup.py
installer/WikidPad.nsi
and the html in lib/pwiki/PersonalWikiFrame.py in the AboutDialog.
yes this could be better.

Run wikidPad using: python WikidPad.py

Open the help wiki. Make sure it is the help wiki under the source tree. Now
click on the root node. This makes sure that the distributed version will open
up on the root node.

Go into the installer directory.
Right click on WikidPad.nsi and select Compile NSI.
